 The American West is central to the construction of America’s identity and popular culture.  The mythology of the American West, built on a narrow foundation of Euro-American settlement and conquest, is critical to understanding the role of the West in the national narrative of American history. Using a variety of materials, including films, art and photography, literature, and historical sources, this course will examine how writers, artists, actors, settlers, and government officials, among others, shaped the creation of the mythic West.  This course will investigate what - and who - is and is not considered part of this mythology, as well as the ways in which these constructs attempted to make sense of the diverse populations converging in the West.

 This course examines Native American history since 1871. We begin with an introduction to indigenous history before 1871, characterized by centuries of Euro-American attempts to colonize and Christianize, to assimilate Native bodies and allot Native lands. We will then analyze the ways in which Native Americans have continually fought to sustain their cultures, languages, and religions, as well as their political and socio-economic structures, throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries. Focusing on themes such as Native resistance to the development of U.S. federal policies and the proliferation of Native culture, we will also consider the shifting nature of Native American sovereignty and the importance of indigenous identity in regards to the experiences of Native Americans. Meets the post-1800 requirement, and can count towards "Colonization and Empire," or "Race and Indigeneity," or "Law and Social Justice," or "North America" fields of the History major.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and Differences, Writing WACourse Materials:AMST 226-01

This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also aims to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities. The course also asks students to consider narrative, voice and audience in historical writing, paying particular attention to the ways in which black women’s history has been written over the course of the twentieth century.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:AMST 229-01

 Asian Americans are often overlooked in the study of religion in the U.S., and yet the impact of Asian religious practices can be seen at every turn: yoga studios, mindfulness meditation, "zen" aesthetics of minimalism, and so on. What do we make of the gap between how Asian religions are practiced in Asian American communities and how these traditions have been reinterpreted by predominantly white, educated, middle class adherents? How do Asian American Christians negotiate their identities in the context of non-Asian Christian churches or the intergenerational tensions within their own ethnic churches? The approach of this course is interdisciplinary (and sometimes counterdisciplinary); it draws on theoretical and methodological insights from ethnic studies, religious studies, history, and sociology. Topics include: race and the racialization of Asian Americans; the politics of cultural and religious exchange; the commodification of Asian religious practices; and issues of assimilation and hybridity within Asian American Christian traditions.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:AMST 241-01

 This course explores Malcolm X: the man, the myth, and the movement. X was a man of many pieces, sometimes contradictory, that we explore through various representations: autobiographical, screenplay and film, hip hop music and culture, black international opinion, FBI surveillance documents, and a young adult novel co-written by his daughter Ilyasah Shabazz. To some extent, we will engage in a genre study. How does genre —autobiography, biography/history, fiction, hip hop and outlaw cultures —influence representation? How should we think about the continuities and discontinuities among historical, autobiographical, and fictional representations of Malcolm X? Questions we will explore include: Who is representing Malcolm, how and why? How are the various representations inflected by their respective media and genre? Why do we engage in myth-making? Can we distinguish Malcolm the man from Malcolm the myth? How does the religious studies category of “hagiography help us to understand some representations of Malcolm X? What are the perils of hagiography? Was Malcolm’s religion merely a prop for his politics? Assuming it was not, how do we do justice to the religious dimensions of his life? How does Malcolm X’s religious itinerary help us understand who he was? In the last third of the course, we explore Malcolm X as a revolutionary by comparing him with two contemporaries, Frantz Fanon, a revolutionary activist, anti-colonial theorist, and critic of antiblackness (1925-1961); and Amilcar Cabral, revolutionary poet and leader of the anticolonial struggle in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (1924-1973).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:AMST 294-02

Working in partnership with the International Institute of Minnesota, an organization based in St. Paul that prepares recently arrived immigrants and refugees for the workplace, students will interview local émigrés from different parts of the world about the first jobs that they had in the U.S., and will create a video based on these conversations. Our goal will be to preserve and share these stories in order to encourage public engagement with issues of immigration, labor, and economic justice, and to foster understanding of and compassion for the members of the diverse immigrant communities in the Twin Cities. Another aim of this course will be to help students think through their own ideas about work and potential career paths as they engage with community members who have grappled with these issues. Each week in class we will discuss shared readings, which will include literary texts, media articles, and scholarship, and will work together to advance our project. No prior experience or knowledge are required.Course Materials:AMST 294-04

 In his unpublished essay, "I choose exile," Richard Wright declared, "To live in Paris is to allow one’s sensibilities to be moved by physical beauty.  I love my adopted city.  Its sunsets, its teeming boulevards, its slow and humane tempo of life have entered deeply into my heart."  Paulette Nardal wrote in her essay "Awakening of Racial Consciousness" that living in Paris in the 1920s had created for Black women the "need of racial solidarity that would not be merely material" and an "awakening to race consciousness" that they had not experienced or understood fully before leaving home and meeting Blacks from other countries in Paris.This course will look at the relationship that Blacks have had to France in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  We will explore the art, literature, music and political protest that were generated in the "City of Lights."  The presence of African Americans has usually been seen, by both themselves and others, as a commentary on race.  We will examine the lives of Blacks who left the United States expressly to escape the burdens of discrimination and came to Paris as self-conscious refugees from racism.  We will also examine the lives of Blacks who left the French colonies to pursue a western education in France, but who developed broader philosophical ideologies, including the cultural, artistic and literary movements of la Négritude. We will examine their experiences and critique the myth of a color-blind France. Prerequisite(s): FREN 204 or higherDistribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:AMST 336-01

 This course explores the history and politics of, and theoretical approaches to, gender and sexuality in relation to the racial politics of mass incarceration, or what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls the "carceral geography" of the United States. By engaging recent work in queer and trans studies, feminist studies, and critical prison studies, we will consider how prisons and policing have shaped the making and remaking of race, gender, and sexuality from slavery and conquest to the contemporary period. We will examine how police and prisons have regulated the body, identity, and populations, and the larger social, political, and cultural changes connected to these processes. While we will focus on the carceral system itself, we will also think of policing in a more expansive way by analyzing the racialized regulation of gender and sexuality on the plantation, in the colony, at the border, in the welfare office, and in the hospital, among other spaces, historical periods, and places.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:AMST 355-01

 This course examines and critically analyzes various approaches to the study of how different individuals and communities in particular historical and cultural scenarios in contemporary Latin America create meanings about their past experience with political violence. The course addresses questions related to the tension between remembering and forgetting, the presence of conflicting memories and truths and how these are negotiated or not through distinct forms of representation. The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling. Finally, the course will also compel students to think about what consequences the politics of memory in postwar Latin America. The content and discussion in this course will necessarily engage with historical contexts and personal testimonies of violence that include arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual violence, genocide, massacres, extrajudicial execution and disappearances. Much of the material will be emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with. We will do our best to flag especially graphic or intense content that discusses or represents violence and will do our best to make this classroom a space where we can engage bravely, empathetically and thoughtfully with difficult content every week.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:ANTH 251-01

 Cultural heritage sites, including libraries, archives and museums, have existed in some shape or form for a very long time. Computers, on the other hand, have only been a part of these institutions for about sixty years. Although technologies offer more efficient and cost-effective ways to store and disseminate information and promise greater accessibility to materials, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they successfully facilitate the missions of these cultural heritage sites or the needs of their visitors. Why is this the case? Do digital technologies truly have the potential to decentralize and democratize these spaces? What can they tell us about what we value, as a culture? In this interdisciplinary course, we will reflect on the impact of digital technologies on cultural heritage sites, and museums in particular, starting in the 1960s and continuing through the present, including discussion of how museums responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, students will learn how to collect, curate, and digitize objects, write and design an object label, and contribute to an online exhibition.

 This hands-on studio class serves as an introduction to the rich and diverse field of inquiry we call sculpture. Over the course of the semester we will investigate a variety of concepts, materials, and fabrication methods employed in the realization of sculptural works. Examples of fabrication methods may include basic woodworking techniques, carving, basic sewing techniques, "non-traditional" techniques, and others. The early part of the semester is devoted to brief exercises that introduce materials, processes, techniques, tools/equipment, and ways of thinking/unthinking. The latter part of the semester is devoted to fully realized individual projects. Final projects are self-assigned and self-directed via prompts. In addition to the formal and spatial aspects of the sculptures we create, we will consider their symbolic, sociopolitical, ethical, material, and tactile dimensions. Slide presentations, short readings, critiques, group discussions, and gallery/museum visits supplement our studio research. The goal of this class is to conduct a serious and sustained - yet playful - inquiry into the question of sculpture while nurturing individual expression. This class is appropriate for any and all curious students interested in play, thinking with the hands, and reflecting on the results. $150 materials fee charged.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsCourse Materials:ART 235-01

The profound political, social, economic, and cultural transformations that took place in Russia and Eastern Europe also had a significant impact on the artistic climate in China and Cuba. As the cultural imperatives of the communist state became radically redefined, the function of a work of art shifted from a conduit of propaganda to a vehicle for social change and political contestation. The course will also examine the motives of thinkers and leaders important for the spread of communism, including Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Castro, Che Guevara, and Mao. The course interrogates binaries of race and gender; democracy/authoritarianism; religion/secularism, and liberalism/conservatism— issues that are at the heart of current political debates worldwide.

Course Details:
 The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years has been, literally, revolutionary. From the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and the emergence of the Chinese Republic (1912-1949) to the radical changes at work during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) under Mao Zedong and the appearance of complex reactionary artistic voices since the late 1970s, we have seen the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design have played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a formal and symbolic language through which communities and notions of personhood could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture to delve into the rich resonance between the representation of the human figure and the expression of diverse identities. Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of "Chinese" art and "Chinese" identity in Asia and on the global stage.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WACourse Materials:ART 350-01

From the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and the emergence of the Chinese Republic (1912-1949) to the radical changes at work during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) under Mao Zedong and the appearance of complex reactionary artistic voices since the late 1970s, we have seen the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design have played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a formal and symbolic language through which communities and notions of personhood could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture to delve into the rich resonance between the representation of the human figure and the expression of diverse identities. Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of "Chinese" art and "Chinese" identity in Asia and on the global stage.

 Asian Americans are often overlooked in the study of religion in the U.S., and yet the impact of Asian religious practices can be seen at every turn: yoga studios, mindfulness meditation, "zen" aesthetics of minimalism, and so on. What do we make of the gap between how Asian religions are practiced in Asian American communities and how these traditions have been reinterpreted by predominantly white, educated, middle class adherents? How do Asian American Christians negotiate their identities in the context of non-Asian Christian churches or the intergenerational tensions within their own ethnic churches? The approach of this course is interdisciplinary (and sometimes counterdisciplinary); it draws on theoretical and methodological insights from ethnic studies, religious studies, history, and sociology. Topics include: race and the racialization of Asian Americans; the politics of cultural and religious exchange; the commodification of Asian religious practices; and issues of assimilation and hybridity within Asian American Christian traditions.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:ASIA 241-01

 The sense of being out of place in one’s society or one’s nation, estranged from one’s self or the world - this is the feeling that has motivated many of the narratives of modern Japanese fiction. Through stories of precocious adolescents, outcast minorities, vagabond women, disillusioned soldiers, and rebellious youth, this course examines the social implications of narrative fiction (including film, anime, and manga) within the context of modern Japanese history. While introducing methods of literary analysis and developing a familiarity with major works of Japanese fiction, the course aims to cultivate an understanding of how stories can be used to engage and think abou the quandaries of modern society. We will explore the way these narratives express marginal experiences, rethink the foundations of human and societal bonds, and articulate new ways of being in the world. Works covered include stories by Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Mishima Yukio, and Murakami Haruki, as well as films by Akira Kurosawa, Koreeda Hirokazu, and Otomo Katsuhiro.

 This collaboratively taught course examines the literature and arts of two empires in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Ming China, an ancient empire sitting at the apogee of its influence yet soon to be crushed by rebellion and invasion, and Tudor-Stuart England, a nascent empire clamoring to assert its dominance as a global superpower through mercantile capitalism, racialized enslavement, and cultural supremacy. Using a literary and comparativist approach, we analyze the function of literature in the winning and losing of empire. We focus, in particular, on the literary writer’s role in shaping the public understanding of law and justice, race and ethnicity, barbarity and civility. We will read courtly literature written for the Chinese and English literati as well as popular texts (plays, songs, poems) aimed at popular audiences. We will visit the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Bell Museum to study Chinese and English material objects (including houseware, furniture, and maps), and practice holding conversation with scholars specializing in early modern China and England.

 Is caste a long-standing social structure or a recent construct? Does it belong to the past or continue to shape lives today? Is it unique to Hindus in South Asia, or does it have a global impact? In this course, we will delve into the intricacies of caste as a social practice. We’ll analyze the historical development of caste and its interactions with other hierarchies, such as race, gender, and sexuality, not only in South Asia but around the world. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize how caste transcends geographical boundaries, examining its portrayal in diverse sources such as literature, ethnographies, censuses, and legal documents. We will also closely examine the histories and lasting effects of anti-caste movements. Our exploration begins in the 19th century when colonialism reshaped caste dynamics while also providing opportunities for marginalized communities to challenge established power structures. Additionally, we will investigate the emergence of caste practices within Afro-Caribbean diaspora communities. Lastly, we will explore the contemporary dimensions of caste, considering how it influences social mobility and marginalization within the context of global migration and social movements. In essence, this course will equip you with fresh perspectives on caste, with an emphasis on primary sources.Course Materials:ASIA 294-03

In this course, we will focus on cities in East, Southeast and South Asia. We will first contextualize the rapid urbanization in the region’s changing political economy, and identify urban issues that are unique to this region. We will further explore different theoretical approaches to understand Asian cities; several of them challenge mainstream urban theories rooted in the experiences of West European and North American cities. Upon the completion of this course, students will acquire substantive knowledge on contemporary trends of urban development in Asia, and develop familiarity with related ongoing theoretical debates. In addition, students will conduct individual research projects to develop deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes in Asia.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WACourse Materials:ASIA 320-01

Course Details:
 The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years has been, literally, revolutionary. From the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and the emergence of the Chinese Republic (1912-1949) to the radical changes at work during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) under Mao Zedong and the appearance of complex reactionary artistic voices since the late 1970s, we have seen the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design have played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a formal and symbolic language through which communities and notions of personhood could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture to delve into the rich resonance between the representation of the human figure and the expression of diverse identities. Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of "Chinese" art and "Chinese" identity in Asia and on the global stage.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WACourse Materials:ASIA 350-01

We will emphasize biological nutrient and energy cycling, population dynamics, animal and plant species interactions, disturbances and response to disturbances, and ecology in urban and agricultural landscapes. We will examine Ecology under four conceptual ’lenses’: Climate Change, Environmental Justice, Land Use, and Ecosystem Services. These lenses provide critical insight into how scientists, policy makers, land managers, and other stakeholders evaluate complex ecological and environmental systems. Labs will be field and data-based, and emphasize the development of hypotheses, novel data collection at Ordway Field Station, and statistical analysis. Three hours lecture and one three-hour laboratory each week.

 Cells are the foundational organizing units of all life on our planet.  In this course, we study the ways in which these nanomachines use the shapes and interactions of molecules to store and convert information, energy, and mass, and to communicate with their environments.  The workings of single-celled bacteria to multicellular organisms, and the complex behaviors of multi-species ecosystems all depend on the working of these miniscule molecular gears packed inside cells. This course covers the structures and behavior of biological molecules, the metabolic reactions that power life, the properties of the fluid, complex membranes that organize biological molecules in space and time, the ways in which information is sent and received within and between cells, and molecular-scale understandings of health and disease processes.  Three lecture hours each week.

This course covers the structures and behavior of biological molecules, the metabolic reactions that power life, the properties of the fluid, complex membranes that organize biological molecules in space and time, the ways in which information is sent and received within and between cells, and molecular-scale understandings of health and disease processes.  Three lecture hours each week.

 Biodiversity is fast disappearing from the face of the planet. To keep a check on wildlife species, populations, and individuals, we need robust methods to enumerate individual and population scale processes such as abundance, distribution, resource use, and behavior. In this course you will be exposed to the fundamentals of wildlife monitoring techniques and their relevant applications. We will learn about wildlife census techniques and how these methods have been used to expand and champion wildlife conservation.

Course Details:
 Global change – or planetary-level changes to land, oceans, and the atmosphere – is one of the most critical societal challenges of the 21st century.  In this course, students will use multiple forms of science communication to explore the ‘global’ part of global change, including by writing a new Wikipedia article for a BIPOC scientist, highlighting a solution to a global change challenge for a pop science audience, and practicing scientific technical writing by proposing a global change biology experiment. We will work through different global change “modules” that look at climate change, land use change, biodiversity loss, and environmental health, with a strong interdisciplinary link to environmental justice issues throughout.  We aim to focus on environmental problems and solutions on a changing planet while pointing a spotlight at regions that will be impacted first and most severely by global change.

Course Details:
 This is an advanced course that will focus on the study of drugs used to alter the central nervous system. The course will begin with basic pharmacological principles and then concentrate on the various uses of drugs to alter brain neurochemistry. Topics for discussion will include the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, depression, pain, anxiety and generally, the neurochemical basis of behavior. In addition to discussion of the use of drugs for clinical purposes, a significant amount of time will be spent on the use of "drugs of abuse" (e.g. cocaine, marijuana, LSD). While the focus of the course will be on the biochemical mechanisms of these drugs, an effort will be made to investigate and discuss the sociological ramifications of drug use. Three discussion/lecture hours per week.

 This course provides an intuitive, yet rigorous, understanding of how energy is stored and transferred in chemical systems. We start with the behavior of individual atoms and molecules (using the foundation of atomic and molecular structure laid in CHEM 111 , and then build up to the macroscopic concepts of thermodynamics. We focus on free energy as a powerful tool for predicting physical and chemical behavior. We then apply our understanding of energetics to electrochemical systems and the rates of chemical reactions. Three lectures and one three-hour laboratory per week. Lab fee of $7 required. Prerequisite(s): CHEM 111 with a grade of C- or better, or satisfactory performance on a placement examination, or a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Chemistry test, or a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the IB Chemistry test.

Course Details:
 Polymer and macromolecular chemistry combine to form a highly interdisciplinary field that cuts across all areas of modern chemistry.  In particular, the preparation of polymeric and macromolecular materials can be used to illustrate many of the fundamental concepts of synthetic chemistry.  Like small molecules as applied in medicines, polymeric and macromolecular materials occupy a central role in maintaining overall societal well-being.  However, unlike small molecules, which are typically synthesized and used as discreet, homogeneous compounds, polymeric and macromolecular materials are usually synthesized and used as a heterogeneous distribution of compounds of the same structural motif but varying size.  This course will explore: a) key historical developments (and people) giving rise to modern polymer and macromolecular chemistry; b) classical and contemporary protocols for polymer and macromolecular synthesis; c) compare and contrast physical properties of small, mono-disperse molecules with those of large, poly-disperse polymer and macromolecular substances; d) applications of polymer and macromolecular materials to societal needs.

Course Details:
 This collaboratively taught course examines the literature and arts of two empires in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Ming China, an ancient empire sitting at the apogee of its influence yet soon to be crushed by rebellion and invasion, and Tudor-Stuart England, a nascent empire clamoring to assert its dominance as a global superpower through mercantile capitalism, racialized enslavement, and cultural supremacy. Using a literary and comparativist approach, we analyze the function of literature in the winning and losing of empire. We focus, in particular, on the literary writer’s role in shaping the public understanding of law and justice, race and ethnicity, barbarity and civility. We will read courtly literature written for the Chinese and English literati as well as popular texts (plays, songs, poems) aimed at popular audiences. We will visit the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Bell Museum to study Chinese and English material objects (including houseware, furniture, and maps), and practice holding conversation with scholars specializing in early modern China and England. No knowledge of Chinese (let alone classical Chinese) is needed. This course counts for the English Major period requirement (Renaissance).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:CHIN 294-01

 In Chinese, writing is synonymous with culture: word for writing is synonymous with civilization itself. This course explores the central role of writing – especially the cultural history of Chinese characters – both in and beyond China from ancient times to the present. How did this unique writing system develop? How have the graphs changed over time? What binds Chinese characters to other art forms – like painting, poetry, calligraphy, sculpture, and dance – or to ethical or spiritual self-cultivation? How do characters, incised in stone or brushed onto paper, transmit meaning? And how did they become the predominant writing system used throughout East and Southeast Asia in premodern times? What myths have been told about their origins, how have they been misconstrued, and what accounts for their extraordinary longevity? No knowledge of Chinese is required.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:CHIN 294-02

 Why are Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin all taught in the same department at Macalester? Today Islam and the Arab world are often presented in contrast with the West in a sort of timeless and unending ’clash of civilizations.’ Classics 101 aims to counter this narrative by exploring the multiple deep, long-term connections among the languages, religions and peoples around the Mediterranean Sea. What were the relationships among speakers of these languages in the past? How did Judaism, Christianity and Islam develop among them? Why are Greek and Roman traditions sometimes seen as in tension with Christian or Arab traditions -- and has that always been the case? Readings include selections from Genesis, Exodus, Homer, Herodotus, Euripides, Plato, Vergil, the Gospels, Josephus, Imru Al-Qays, the Qur’an and 1,001 Nights. Legendary and historical figures include Moses, Helen of Troy, Cyrus, Darius, Pericles, Alexander, Cleopatra, Jesus, Augustus, Perpetua, Constantine, Muhammad, Fatima, Aisha and Omar. Suggested subtitles for the course include Before East and West, We Hear Dead People, Great Books Reimagined, and Hey, You Should Know This Stuff.

 Art reflects, refracts and helps construct a society’s culture. Thousands of pieces of sculpture survive from the ancient Roman period and can provide valuable information to the historian. Material from Rome includes looted Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian sculpture, copies of antique masterpieces, and new creations combining different styles for varied purposes. After we develop a basic history and understanding of Roman sculpture, this course will examine select pieces each week to explore questions that may be productively brought to bear on this unusual historical source. For example, the popularity and adaptations of masterpieces of Venus, Dionysus and Apollo will be used to explore the way artists shaped differences between male and female and the cultural assumptions about sexuality and the body these works communicate (Knidian Aphrodite, Praxitelean youths, Sleeping Hermaphrodite). In turn, we will investigate how these artistic conventions for gender could be employed to communicate the subjugation of enslaved or conquered people and the authority of the emperor (Antinoos Sculptures, Suicide Gauls, Dying Gaul, Marcus Aurelius reliefs, Portonaccio Sarcophagus). We will also look at self-representation, including how former slaves chose to present themselves in hyper-realistic portraits on their tombs; how this may have impacted Roman portraiture as a whole; and what it meant for some members of the elite to put such hyper-realistic portrait heads onto the bodies of gods and goddesses (Tomb of the Haterii, Tomb of Rabiria, Tivoli General, Flavian Matron as Venus). What can these varied representations of the human form tell us about the complex interplay of legal status, citizenship, gender, nudity, ethnicity, power, vulnerability and identity in the Roman Empire? The course will meet once a week during the day to allow for two field trips to see sculpture in the round. Responses to the weekly readings will be due every week. During the last third of the course, students will direct our classwork as they build toward a final project. No formal prerequisites, but some prior experience with ancient art, art history or Roman history is recommended.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:CLAS 394-01

 Videogames dominate entertainment culture. But like all popular forms of entertainment, they are often looked down upon as aesthetically superficial, intellectually uncomplicated, and somehow bad for you. They are "just pop culture." Like Shakespeare was in his time. Like the novel was when it was invented. And like film and television shows were when they were invented. This course takes seriously the deep intellectual and aesthetic value of videogames and of videogame making. Videogames are expanding the possibilities and the borders of storytelling and narrative design. They are pushing the limits of coding wizardry. They have also become one of the most creative popular-cultural sites for experimenting with and understanding other minds and identities. In this class, students will work in interdisciplinary teams to bring world-building narrative techniques to an immersive visual setting while exploring technical challenges involved in programming and game development through hands-on projects. Prerequisite(s): COMP 127 only if course is taken as the Computer Science cross-list.Course Materials:COMP 325-01

 Through the decades, value has been placed on the importance of education. More specifically, those who pursue technology-based education like Computer Science learn a multitude of technical practices, techniques, logic, and languages to build and design future technologies. These technologies are solutions to world problems or may be hobbyist in nature. Regardless, artifacts produced by Computer Scientists, Engineers, Programmers, and other similar stakeholders have suffered immeasurably through lack of training and awareness on social issues. As a result, we observe in society the numerous technologies that currently exist (intentionally or unintentionally) to perpetuate racism, oppressive power structures, and injustices on vulnerable and minority populations. Should these technologies be redesigned or thrown out all together? How can we connect the design and development of technologies to the behaviors of minoritized identities? This course will introduce students both to critical thinking and practice in understanding how software and tools, their processes and practices can become instruments that reinforce and exacerbate inequality in society. Once we confront the ways in which technologies contribute to systems of inequality, we will begin to identify relevant problems and solutions to contribute to a more equal, just society. This course will be reading and discussion-oriented.  COMP 123 is recommended.Course Materials:COMP 394-01

 This course examines the workings of economic systems from the perspective of the incentives facing the firm and consumer. The course provides an introduction to the economics of information and organization which is used to evaluate resource allocation under the specific institutional environment of different economic systems. Our understanding of the incentive system is then used to evaluate the overall economic system. The focus of the course is primarily on the U.S. economy, Japan and the former Soviet Union/Russia. As time permits the course may examine China, Germany and Central Europe. This course counts as a Group E elective. Prerequisite(s): ECON 119 or ECON 129. C- or higher required for all prerequisites.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:ECON 225-01

 This course studies the economics of public policy toward the environment. We begin by examining the problem of market failure in the presence of externalities and public goods. Then, we consider public policy responses to these market failures, including command-and-control regulations, tax and subsidy incentives, marketable pollution permits, voluntary programs, and information as regulation. We consider these policies in contexts such as local pollution, climate change, threats to biodiversity, environmental justice, international trade, and development. In addition, we learn how to measure the costs and benefits of pollution control.  By the end of the semester, you will learn how economists think about environmental problems, understand the advantages and disadvantages of a range of environmental policies, be able to conduct a cost-benefit analysis, and have a complete economic analysis of an environmental problem. This course counts as a Group E elective. Prerequisite(s): ECON 119 or ECON 129.

 In microeconomics, we study how individuals make economic choices. We pose questions like: What influences consumers’ purchasing decisions? Will firms replace employees with machines if the minimum wage increases? How do concentrated markets (e.g., airlines, Amazon) affect consumers? If a firm can set different prices for different consumers, what set of prices will be optimal? How do risk and uncertainty affect investment decisions? What is the efficient amount of pollution? What role should governments play in providing resources for public goods like parks? In this course, we derive models of constrained choice to examine fundamental tradeoffs faced by individuals, firms, and governments when making economic decisions and to determine how such decisions influence market outcomes and well-being. This course counts as a Group E elective. Prerequisite(s): MATH 135 or MATH 137, and one 200-level Economics course from Group E electives.

These models will be used to address the three main questions of macroeconomics: What causes long-term economic growth to vary over time and across countries? Which forces drive fluctuations in economic activity and inflation throughout the business cycle? What role, if any, do monetary and fiscal policy play in fostering economic growth and minimizing economic fluctuations? This is one of the four courses required for the economics major.

These derivations will help us evaluate the causes and consequences of international trade and FDI; and 2) an applied component where we evaluate and apply econometric research to examine the interactions between trade, FDI and a variety of issues including productivity, the labor market effects in home and host countries, economic development and inequality, convergence or polarization of global cultures, and natural disasters. The course grade will be based on group presentations, reading responses, two exams, and a capstone-level research project.

 Mental health and wellbeing among school-aged youth in the US has been generally declining in recent decades, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and multiple social crises (eg, gun violence, hate crimes, political instability). How can teachers and school support services help prevent or reduce the negative effects on students’ mental health? How does the existing system of education contribute to emotional, behavioral, and mental problems among students and educators? How does this system add to disparities in educational outcomes among students who have been marginalized based on their identities? This course will examine both the educational systems and policies that affect preK-16 student mental health as well as individual-level practices that may intervene toward well-being. Throughout this course, students will engage with psychological theory, research, practical examples, and school-based mental health practitioners, including school psychologists, social workers, counselors, and special educators.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:EDUC 294-02

Additionally, we will work with visual media, from RuPaul’s DragRace to Gentleman Jack. Come ready to play with fabric and historical fashion, no prior experience required! In this class, we will learn the basics of sewing, giving us tangible insight into the long history of clothing and “women’s work”.

 In this course we will dive right into the study of creative writing by reading and writing poetry,
flash fiction, short stories, and personal essays. We will study how published authors craft their pieces, how they convey sensation and emotion, and how they artfully tell a story. Along the way, you’ll try your hand at each literary form we study. This is the basic template you can
expect on a day-to-day basis. But, beyond this relatively simple pattern, what I hope will
happen this term is that you’ll lose yourself to the daring act of creating literature. I hope you’ll
use your growing knowledge of writing technique and literary history to say something fearless
and artful about the world around you. And I hope you will see that what you write matters.
Great creative writing aspires to more than just a pleasant diversion from life. At its best, it
directly engages with life and even tries to change it. We look to stories, poems, and essays to
give us an experience in language that we’ve never had before, to deepen our knowledge of the world, and to allow us into the hearts and minds of others. I hope this semester will be a window into that experience for you.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WCCourse Materials:ENGL 150-01

explore through poetry, fiction, and personal essays. We will learn to get lost, to ask the hardest questions. The first half of the semester will focus on generative experiments. We’ll play with different ways of approaching the page and the writing process. We might write one line a day or try to write an entire story in an hour. The second half of the semester, we’ll learn to revise and offer feedback. Editing and redrafting can lead to unexpected awakenings. Often in revising work, we also revise how we see ourselves and our world. We will begin workshopping with the aim of pushing each other to ask deeper questions and to honor and strengthen the heart of a piece. You will leave this class with a stack of drafts and hopefully a better sense of yourself as a person and as a writer.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WCCourse Materials:ENGL 150-04

 Videogames dominate entertainment culture. But like all popular forms of entertainment, they are often looked down upon as aesthetically superficial, intellectually uncomplicated, and somehow bad for you. They are "just pop culture." Like Shakespeare was in his time. Like the novel was when it was invented. And like film and television shows were when they were invented. This course takes seriously the deep intellectual and aesthetic value of videogames and of videogame making. Videogames are expanding the possibilities and the borders of storytelling and narrative design. They are pushing the limits of coding wizardry. They have also become one of the most creative popular-cultural sites for experimenting with and understanding other minds and identities. In this class, students will work in interdisciplinary teams to bring world-building narrative techniques to an immersive visual setting while exploring technical challenges involved in programming and game development through hands-on projects. Prerequisite(s): None if taken as the English cross-list.Course Materials:ENGL 224-01

In this case, students must do the reading and writing assignments and some of their oral presentations in German.What does the internationally (mis)used word "kafkaesque" actually mean? This course approaches Kafka’s work both as a case for literary analysis and as one that offers insights into modernism. In one way or another, Kafka sheds light on massive industrialization, bureaucratization, the commodification of art, the destabilization of patriarchy, and the development of technology and media, as well as on the question: what is literature itself. In addition to a selection of Kafka’s fiction, we shall read Crumb and Mairowitz’s graphic version of Kafka’s life and work, allowing students to produce their own graphic group project.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:ENGL 235-01

The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:ENGL 263-01

 This course is an introduction to the study of literature and human rights. We will seek to better understand the contemporary norms and practices of human rights by examining its deep historical contexts, and by considering the philosophical and religious debates that continue to shape human rights theory and practice. We will also examine theories of trauma and torture, personal accounts of human rights and humanitarian fieldwork, representational ethics, and studies of human rights in film and media. We will scrutinize relevant literary texts as works of art, as case studies in human rights, and as models for understanding how words can change the world, whether in the form of human rights reports and newspaper accounts or of poems and novels. We will seek to better understand how spectators of suffering develop (or fail to develop) empathy for distant persons or for persons considered alien by also examining how they can so palpably feel for the dreams, desires, and dignity of fictional persons. In The Defense of Poesy Sir Philip Sidney describes the tyrant, Alexander Pheraeus, "from whose eyes a tragedy well-made and represented drew abundance of tears; who without all pity had murdered infinite numbers, and some of his own blood, so as he that was not ashamed to make matters for tragedies, yet could not resist the sweet violence of a tragedy." What is the line that separates those who are merely moved from those who are moved to act? When does the story become real enough to change you? Our list of authors will span the range of intellectual and ethical endeavor, from ancient Greek plays and philosophy to contemporary US literature.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:ENGL 265-01

curiosity rather than fear? If we abandon the pressure to make something “good”? Our goals will be to experiment and get messy, to build a creative practice rooted in love and delight.

plot, description as emotion, and the unreliable narrator. Everyone will write a series of stories

are no hard and fast rules here. The principles of writing are, at best, valuable hints accrued
from centuries of literature, and, at worst, limits to a writer’s developing sensibility. Ideally, by

They will read new and contemporary plays that employ different storytelling techniques (i.e., structure, character arcs, staging elements, etc.), embrace the unlimited possibilities of theatricality, and exemplify why we write for the stage. Students will develop a "playwriting toolkit" as they explore their artistic interests following the conventions of time-bound pieces: the 1-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, and ultimately one-act form. In-class exercises and prompts, and small-group workshopping and reading will challenge each writer’s individual development. A mid-term and final play reading series of one-acts will allow students to hear their work in a supportive public setting. May be repeated for credit.

 Word for word, Emily Dickinson is the most powerful writer in the history of the English language. She is the King of All Media, the feature star in movies, television, radio, lawsuits and criminal investigations, novels, AI language models, cookbooks, museums, a video game, and just about every other possible platform of public fascination. Barring Shakespeare, no other English or American poet has been the focus of such fervid public devotion. What’s behind this cult of Dickinson? In our class you will find out. You will study Dickinson’s poems, which are teasingly fun, hair-raisingly creepy, romantically uplifting, existentially wrenching, philosophically staggering, and aesthetically gorgeous. You will also study Dickinson herself. Transformed into a mythical figure since her death in 1886, she has been used as a symbol to embody a range of bitterly conflicting cultural fantasies. To understand the history of Emily Dickinson is to understand some of the most painful—and liberating—ideological revolutions in modern US history. This course fulfills the 19th-c.

 This collaboratively taught course examines the literature and arts of two empires in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Ming China, an ancient empire sitting at the apogee of its influence yet soon to be crushed by rebellion and invasion, and Tudor-Stuart England, a nascent empire clamoring to assert its dominance as a global superpower through mercantile capitalism, racialized enslavement, and cultural supremacy. Using a literary and comparativist approach, we analyze the function of literature in the winning and losing of empire. We focus, in particular, on the literary writer’s role in shaping the public understanding of law and justice, race and ethnicity, barbarity and civility. We will read courtly literature written for the Chinese and English literati as well as popular texts (plays, songs, poems) aimed at popular audiences. We will visit the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Bell Museum to study Chinese and English material objects (including houseware, furniture, and maps), and practice holding conversation with scholars specializing in early modern China and England. No knowledge of Chinese (let alone classical Chinese) is needed. This course counts for the English Major period requirement (Renaissance).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:ENGL 294-06

 Welcome to the naughty 90s—the 1590s. Plague ravages the cities, inflation is high, and poor harvests have depopulated villages. The news of disease, precarity, and political instability keeps the Privy Councilors awake at night, but it fires the imagination of London’s professional playwrights. To tell of England as it was and England as it could be, William Shakespeare writes four interconnected history plays: Richard II, Henry IV, Parts 1 & 2 (featuring the beloved trickster, Sir John Falstaff), and Henry V. These plays—the “second tetralogy”—foreground timeless questions such as the addictiveness of absolute power, the conditional nature of citizenship, and the power of a good story to bind people to nation-building. In Spring 2024, for the first time in 30 years, the Guthrie Theater (in Minneapolis) will be staging all four plays as a cycle, making it possible for us to study the plays as texts and to see them in live performance.

 Music is a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. Your Uber driver wants to know if you’d like to listen to it. It’s playing while you bag up avocados, try on pants, eat a burger. It’s playing while you stretch in the seventh inning or wait in the waiting room. There’s a whole segment of it just for elevators. But sometimes a song cuts through this opaque din. Touches our hearts, soundtracks our lives, makes us want to scream wildly in a room with 20,000 strangers. So what makes a song stand apart? Well, a bit of magic, for sure. But Harlan Howard wasn’t wrong when he said the recipe for any great song is “three chords and the truth”. Strip a song down to its essential elements and you have lyrics, melody, and structure. In this class, we’ll be focusing on these pillars: how to tell a great story (from the personal to the universal), how to write a melody that sticks, and how form can shape the listener’s experience. We’ll examine the modus operandi of prolific songwriters, explore the tricks of the trade for getting started and finishing strong, and work collaboratively to write an album’s worth of hits! To take this class, basic knowledge of a musical instrument, such as guitar or piano, is preferred, but not required. You must simply be able to compose and sing melodies. You will be required to share your compositions with the class, either live or via basic audio recording. Counts as a creative writing elective.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsCourse Materials:ENGL 294-08

 Literature has been an important part of the Twin Cities landscape since their founding. Luminaries from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Louise Erdrich have called the area home, and a vibrant ecosystem of writers, publishers, bookstores, performers, and arts organizations continues to shape this local legacy. In this project-based course, students will make their own contributions to the literary history of the place they live. We’ll spend the semester building an online literary journal together, with each student contributing a single piece. Contributions can be creative, analytical, or journalistic. What counts as “literary” will be broadly defined (and problematized). We’ll also explore options for incorporating digital components (video, audio, maps, games, etc.) into our pieces. Example contributions might include a video-poem about the Skyline Tower apartment building, an oral history of BIPOC bookstores in the Twin Cities, or a digital annotation of James Wright’s “The Minneapolis Poem.” Regular class visitors will talk to us about the Twin Cities literary community and serve as advisors for our pieces. A background in media production (web development, drawing, filmmaking, podcasting, etc.) is welcome but not at all necessary.Course Materials:ENGL 294-09

Course Details:
 This course examines the nineteenth-century British novel through questions of gender, race, and nationality—specifically considering what constitutes a “lady” by various cultural/historical standards and how the construction of ideal femininity worked with and against ideals of masculinity in the period. None of the books we will read suggest all women are (or can be) ladies; nor are all of the men who populate them monsters. Seeking nuance in these terms, the course asks: How were nineteenth-century gender norms complicated by class and race, and what is the space between the ideal and the monstrous? How is a monstrous woman constructed differently than a monstrous man? What makes monstrosity redeemable or irredeemable? What if the world’s monstrosities are not humans but made by them? Obviously, we could not have a course like this without a vampire novel (Carmilla), but we will also read a range of genres that enable
us to talk about labor rights, domestic ideals, love, inheritance politics, colonial
monstrosities, and even sci-fi feminist utopia (“Sultana’s Dream”). We will tackle the problem of genre: what does it mean to have a course focused on “the novel,” when nonwhite writers in the period worked predominantly in every other genre but long-form fiction? And we will consider those voices by including other short forms (a short story, a novella, and some non-fiction). To simulate the Victorian reading experience, we will also consume one novel in small weekly installments all semester, following the sensational exploits of petite, blonde Lady Audley to the point where we ultimately discover her Secrets. Along the way, you’ll get a taste of the Condition-of-England novel (Mary Barton), colonial fantasy (King Solomon’s Mines), and fin-de-siecle aestheticism (The Picture of Dorian Gray) among other things, exploring fictions weird, monstrous, funny, and fearless. This course satisfies the 18th/19th c British literature requirement on the English major; prerequisite: one 100- or 200-level literature course.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:ENGL 331-01

 In this course we will explore writing by Asian American poets working from the late 19th century until the present day. In doing so, we will consider how these writers have used a wide range of poetic forms and strategies to bear witness to social upheaval, to reimagine erased histories, to reclaim various archives, to make space for transnational communities, and even to seek joy and hope. Through our critical and creative attention, we will trouble the "model minority” myth, interrogate what Cathy Park Hong calls the "vague purgatorial status” of Asian Americans in the American imagination, and question the ways American policies (domestically and abroad) have shaped Asian American identities and experiences, and, by extension, Asian American poetries. Readings might include books by Sally Wen Mao, Su Hwang, Agha Shahid Ali, Brandon Shimoda, and Solmaz Sharif. Coursework will include weekly reading responses, biweekly tutorial groups, creative poetic “adaptations,” and two short essays/presentations. This course counts toward the writers of color requirement for the English Major. Prerequisites: Students will preferably have taken

 In this capstone course for the Literature Path of the English major, you will develop an
individual capstone project using advanced research methods. Each of you, in consultation with me, will determine the topic and form for your capstone projects, all of which will include a
written research component, even if they otherwise take some other form, such as digital or
visual/material. We will begin the semester with a shared exploration of Afrofuturism, a
flourishing contemporary movement of Black writers, artists, musicians, and scholars who
imagine, theorize, and represent other times (often, but not always, the future) and alternative
forms of the human, along with outer spaces and other places wherein Black people are centered.  We will begin by studying a few key Afrofuturist texts, such as Janelle Monáe’s videos and Octavia Butler’s fiction, through a series of theoretical approaches, including sound studies, ecocriticism, and queer theory. This combination of primary text and theory will provide a model for your own projects; however, your project need not focus on Afrofuturism. Course requirements include: a presentation, discussion questions on each major reading, a research proposal, and a final capstone project and presentation of that project at the English department capstone event at the end of the semester.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:ENGL 401-01

 In this capstone creative writing seminar, we will compose chapbook-length collections of poems, while reading a wide range of published poetry and essays on poetics, selected to deepen and expand our techne and sense of the lyric. How do we identify the obsessions and aesthetics inherent in our work and then complicate them over the span of a book? How might we cultivate poetic lineages in our writing that will contribute to our artistic growth? How do we theorize our poetics for ourselves? For an audience? Throughout the course, we will consider these questions and others while workshopping poems, discussing craft, and speaking with poets who have recently published books. Readings for the course might include work from Su Hwang, Natalie Diaz, Benjamin Garcia, Yanyi, Sally Wen Mao, and Carl Phillips. The course will culminate with each student producing a chapbook of poems and preparing a presentation about their work. Before Winter Break, students will begin a dialogue with the instructor about how their interests might be reflected in the course readings.

We will emphasize biological nutrient and energy cycling, population dynamics, animal and plant species interactions, disturbances and response to disturbances, and ecology in urban and agricultural landscapes. We will examine Ecology under four conceptual ’lenses’: Climate Change, Environmental Justice, Land Use, and Ecosystem Services. These lenses provide critical insight into how scientists, policy makers, land managers, and other stakeholders evaluate complex ecological and environmental systems. Labs will be field and data-based, and emphasize the development of hypotheses, novel data collection at Ordway Field Station, and statistical analysis. Three hours lecture and one three-hour laboratory each week.

 The study of oceanography is a multidisciplinary pursuit that applies tools from geology, physics, chemistry, and biology to better understand one of Earth’s most unique planetary features. Oceans cover the majority of Earth’s surface and were the birthplace of nearly all complex life on Earth. Ocean currents carry heat, nutrients, and carbon around the globe, influencing Earth’s climate from global to local scales. However, despite its immense size, the ocean system is also highly sensitive to human impacts such as acidification, overfishing, and pollution. This course will provide an overview of the ocean’s physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes and the complex ways in which they interact. We will use oceanographic data to ask and answer questions about modern oceanographic systems. We will also explore human impacts on the oceans in their scientific and socio-political contexts. This course is designed for students with an introductory background in any related discipline, and enthusiasm for approaching science in a multidisciplinary way.Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsCourse Materials:ENVI 180-01

 This course introduces the student to an area of study that brings together and interrelates patterns and processes that drive Earth’s physical environments, including human interactions with the physical environment. Among other topics, we will learn about the principles and mechanisms of climate and weather, water resources, landforms, earth surface processes, landscapes, vegetation, and ecosystems at global and regional scales. We will also learn how the spatial and temporal patterns of these processes are interpreted and understood using maps produced from Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Position System (GPS) and satellite imagery. Using selected studies we will also examine the social forces that shape many of these systems to gain a broader understanding of the socio-environmental interconnections of these physical environments. The course consists of lectures, discussions, hands-on exercises, field excursions, and exams.Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsCourse Materials:ENVI 204-01

 Human beings have an unprecedented ability to shape the environment around them, yet the environment powerfully shapes both individuals and species. Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we’ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we’ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we’ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we’ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them. Knowing what makes a healthy language, we’ll look at endangered languages and the connections between linguistic diversity and biodiversity.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:ENVI 225-01

 This course studies the economics of public policy toward the environment. We begin by examining the problem of market failure in the presence of externalities and public goods. Then, we consider public policy responses to these market failures, including command-and-control regulations, tax and subsidy incentives, marketable pollution permits, voluntary programs, and information as regulation. We consider these policies in contexts such as local pollution, climate change, threats to biodiversity, environmental justice, international trade, and development. In addition, we learn how to measure the costs and benefits of pollution control.  By the end of the semester, you will learn how economists think about environmental problems, understand the advantages and disadvantages of a range of environmental policies, be able to conduct a cost-benefit analysis, and have a complete economic analysis of an environmental problem. Counts as a Group E elective for the Economics major. Prerequisite(s): ECON 119 or ECON 129.

 The Earth’s climate system is complex and dynamic, and yet understanding this system is crucial in order to address concerns about anthropogenic influences on climate. In this course, we examine the basic physical and chemical processes that control the modern climate system, including the role of incoming solar radiation, the greenhouse effect, ocean and atmospheric circulation, and El Nino. We also look critically at the methods and archives used to reconstruct climate in the past, such as ice cores, marine and lake sediments, and cave deposits. We explore the possible effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on modern and future climate by critically examining the models used in climate prediction, and discuss the challenges of modeling such a complex system. Although this course is taught from a primarily scientific perspective, it includes frequent discussions of the roles policy and economics play in the current dialogue on global climate change.Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsGeneral Education Requirements:Quantitative Thinking Q3Course Materials:ENVI 240-01

 All readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) has been called the "savage anomaly" of the Enlightenment because his philosophy enables an alternative or ’hidden’ modernity based on the interdependence of beings rather than their hierarchy. Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature-as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous "imperium" in, yet above, nature-and of society as a continuation of nature-as opposed to the dominant theories of the "social contract" that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the "political" and the "environment." Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:ENVI 274-01

 In the minds of many Americans, cities are places where nature is absent-places where nature exists only in the crevices and on the margins of spaces dominated by technology, concrete, and human artifice. This course confronts this assumption directly, drawing on the scholarship from the relatively young field of urban environmental history to uncover the deep interconnections between urban America and the natural world. Among the other things, we will examine how society has drawn upon nature to build and sustain urban growth, the implications that urban growth has for transforming ecosystems both local and distant, and how social values have guided urbanites as they have built and rearranged the world around them. Using the Twin Cities has a backdrop and constant reference point, we will attempt to understand the constantly changing ways that people, cities, and nature have shaped and reshaped one another throughout American history.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:ENVI 340-01

Course Details:
 The Arctic is Earth’s most rapidly warming region. It is also home to massive carbon reservoirs and diverse biological adaptations to extreme elements, as well as home to Indigenous populations and the site of oil extraction and vanishing sea ice. We will examine how climate change is impacting the biodiversity, ecophysiology, and biogeochemistry of this crucial biome, and as a result, the rest of the world. As an upper-level biology course, Arctic Ecology aims to challenge students to improve their science communication skills through varied written, spoken, and visual presentations. Students will also be challenged to synthesize content across systems and create novel hypotheses about current and future impacts of change at a species, community, ecosystem, and landscape scale. Three lecture hours each week. Prerequisite(s): BIOL 170Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsCourse Materials:ENVI 362-01

 This course is designed to introduce the student to the theory and application of digital imagery data analysis in research. It emphasizes fundamental remote sensing concepts and utilizes remotely-sensed data for analyzing human-environmental issues such as deforestation, urban expansion, or other changes in land surface across space or time. The focus of this course is on the interpretation and applications of data from spaceborne systems (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2), but other sources of remote sensing data (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles) will be introduced too. The course consists of lecture periods to provide a comprehensive understanding of concepts, labs that take you through the major mapping and analysis methods, and student projects. A basic understanding of geographic data is necessary to take this class. Students can satisfy this requirement by completing GEOG 225 (or showing equivalent knowledge) or by completing an asynchronous module provided by the instructor through Moodle.

 Global change – or planetary-level changes to land, oceans, and the atmosphere – is one of the most critical societal challenges of the 21st century.  In this course, students will use multiple forms of science communication to explore the ‘global’ part of global change, including by writing a new Wikipedia article for a BIPOC scientist, highlighting a solution to a global change challenge for a pop science audience, and practicing scientific technical writing by proposing a global change biology experiment. We will work through different global change “modules” that look at climate change, land use change, biodiversity loss, and environmental health, with a strong interdisciplinary link to environmental justice issues throughout.  We aim to focus on environmental problems and solutions on a changing planet while pointing a spotlight at regions that will be impacted first and most severely by global change.

Course Details:
 This introductory course is designed to provide a broad historical overview of cinema in Francophone Africa. We start out with a journey back to Francophone cinema’s roots in the colonial past, when film was enlisted to serve various educational purposes as part of the French civilizing mission. Then we do a deep dive into the early postcolonial period to revisit classics such as Afrique 50, Les Statues meurent aussi, Afrique-sur-Seine, Moi un Noir, among a few others. Finally, beginning with Ousmane Sembene’s 1963 Borom Sarret (The Cart Driver), we chart the history of film in Francophone Africa, including North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Tunisia, and Algeria), from the early sixties to the present. Through readings of key texts and critical discussions with filmmakers and film scholars, students will engage a wide range of issues, including censorship, auteur cinema, ethnographic cinema, counter-ethnographic essay films, popular genres, the contested legacies of Pan-Africanist cinema, gender issues, ecocriticism and eco-cinema, and the combined fallouts from the video and digital revolutions that, as elsewhere, have radically shifted the paradigm of film production and consumption in contemporary Francophone Africa.

 This introductory course is designed to provide a broad historical overview of cinema in Francophone Africa. We start out with a journey back to Francophone cinema’s roots in the colonial past, when film was enlisted to serve various educational purposes as part of the French civilizing mission. Then we do a deep dive into the early postcolonial period to revisit classics such as Afrique 50, Les Statues meurent aussi, Afrique-sur-Seine, Moi un Noir, among a few others.

 In his unpublished essay, "I choose exile," Richard Wright declared, "To live in Paris is to allow one’s sensibilities to be moved by physical beauty.  I love my adopted city.  Its sunsets, its teeming boulevards, its slow and humane tempo of life have entered deeply into my heart."  Paulette Nardal wrote in her essay "Awakening of Racial Consciousness" that living in Paris in the 1920s had created for Black women the "need of racial solidarity that would not be merely material" and an "awakening to race consciousness" that they had not experienced or understood fully before leaving home and meeting Blacks from other countries in Paris.This course will look at the relationship that Blacks have had to France in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  We will explore the art, literature, music and political protest that were generated in the "City of Lights."  The presence of African Americans has usually been seen, by both themselves and others, as a commentary on race.  We will examine the lives of Blacks who left the United States expressly to escape the burdens of discrimination and came to Paris as self-conscious refugees from racism.  We will also examine the lives of Blacks who left the French colonies to pursue a western education in France, but who developed broader philosophical ideologies, including the cultural, artistic and literary movements of la Négritude. We will examine their experiences and critique the myth of a color-blind France. Corequisite(s): FREN 204 or higherDistribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:FREN 336-01

 This course introduces the student to an area of study that brings together and interrelates patterns and processes that drive Earth’s physical environments, including human interactions with the physical environment. Among other topics, we will learn about the principles and mechanisms of climate and weather, water resources, landforms, earth surface processes, landscapes, vegetation, and ecosystems at global and regional scales. We will also learn how the spatial and temporal patterns of these processes are interpreted and understood using maps produced from Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Position System (GPS) and satellite imagery. Using selected studies we will also examine the social forces that shape many of these systems to gain a broader understanding of the socio-environmental interconnections of these physical environments.

 The Neotropical realm refers to the biogeographic region that includes the tropical terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and South America’s temperate zone. These areas provide a range of services-both locally and globally--including water sources, climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. They are also home to various human populations and support the livelihood of local and global human populations. This course provides students a basic understanding of the most important biophysical and social characteristics of the dominant landscapes of the Neotropics. Among others, these include tropical rain forests, Andean páramos, tropical dry forests, wetlands, deserts and temperate forests of southern South America. For each of these landscapes, we will analyze the key climatological, biogeographical and ecological processes and also study the peoples that live in them including indigenous communities, afro-descendants, and mestizos. Finally, using examples of these areas, we also analyze human-environment interactions including land change processes, biodiversity, resource and cultural conservation, and climate change impacts.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:GEOG 239-01

Among other issues, we will explore how colonialism, and even more recent ’development’ initiatives, have influenced current structures in Africa.  Furthermore, we will examine what restrictions, if any, the current world economic system places on development possibilities for the continent. The course provides a basic background in African history and bio-physical environments, leading to discussion of advanced topics in contemporary African studies. We will cover a broad range of sectoral themes, including: health and population dynamics; food and agriculture; cities and urbanization; rural life; parks and peoples; development and underdevelopment; politics and governance; and sociocultural geography and music.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:GEOG 243-01

 The goal of this new seminar-style course is to examine the role of sports in society, taking a critical, interdisciplinary, and international approach anchored in human geography while incorporating fields like sociology, history, and media studies. Key themes of the course include identity, embodied experience, and space and place. How do sports instill or reinforce a sense of national identity, especially in international competitions like the Olympic Games or the soccer World Cup? How do some places become "hotbeds" of sporting talent? How does participation in sports reinforce or challenge hierarchies based on race-, gender-, and sexuality-based identities? How do "street sports" such as skateboarding or parkour promote radical engagements with urban public space? Is new stadium development (as we’ve seen in the Twin Cities in recent years) actually a good economic investment? And how do new stadiums transform local urban spaces? We will explore these questions in intensive class discussions based on academic texts, popular media accounts, and documentaries. We plan (tentatively) to have local field excursions (for example, to learn about local impacts of new stadium development in the Twin Cities and to gather ethnographic data on the gameday spectator experience). Students will have the opportunity to pursue their own sports geography interests more deeply in a final project.

By 2010, the urban population in the Asia-Pacific region had surpassed the population of the United States and the European Union combined. In this course, we will focus on cities in East, Southeast and South Asia. We will first contextualize the rapid urbanization in the region’s changing political economy, and identify urban issues that are unique to this region. We will further explore different theoretical approaches to understand Asian cities; several of them challenge mainstream urban theories rooted in the experiences of West European and North American cities. Upon the completion of this course, students will acquire substantive knowledge on contemporary trends of urban development in Asia, and develop familiarity with related ongoing theoretical debates. In addition, students will conduct individual research projects to develop a deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes in Asia.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WACourse Materials:GEOG 320-01

 This course is designed to introduce the student to the theory and application of digital imagery data analysis in research. It emphasizes fundamental remote sensing concepts and utilizes remotely-sensed data for analyzing human-environmental issues such as deforestation, urban expansion, or other changes in land surface across space or time. The focus of this course is on the interpretation and applications of data from spaceborne systems (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2), but other sources of remote sensing data (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles) will be introduced too. The course consists of lecture periods to provide a comprehensive understanding of concepts, labs that take you through the major mapping and analysis methods, and student projects. A basic understanding of geographic data is necessary to take this class. Students can satisfy this requirement by completing GEOG 225 (or showing equivalent knowledge) or by completing an asynchronous module provided by the instructor through Moodle. Prerequisite(s): Permission of instructor.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Quantitative Thinking Q3Course Materials:GEOG 362-01

 This course introduces students to the geographic study of development around the world, with a particular emphasis on the Global South. The geographic approach emphasizes: the highly uneven nature of development; processes that link and differentiate various areas of the world; connections between development and the natural resource base; and the power relations inherent in development discourse. The course has three main sections: an introduction to development theory; an investigation of various development themes; and an intense exploration of what works and what doesn’t in development practice. While much of the development literature has focused on failure, a specific aim of this course will be to uncover and interrogate success stories.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WACourse Materials:GEOG 363-01

Course Details:
 The 21st century is an urban century. Half of the world’s population now lives in cities, with the most rapid growth happening in the developing world. The globalized urban processes compel us to rethink existing urban theories as well as the very definition of cities. In this senior capstone seminar, we will explore three strands of scholarly works that expand our knowledge about contemporary global urbanism. The first focuses on the scholarship of neoliberal urbanism, which prioritizes North American and Western European urban experiences and shapes the mainstream thinking of cities. The second consists of on-the-ground variegated contestations, which reveal diverse urban living experiences and propose alternative approaches to the capitalist urbanization process. Finally, there is the scholarship challenging mainstream urban theories with a different epistemological stance. Among other things, it seeks to re-conceptualize urbanization from the global South. In addition to studying these important ways of thinking about global urbanism, students will conduct individual research projects to develop a deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:GEOG 472-01

In this course we’ll "dig in" to explore dinosaurs in their world and examine their evolution, biology, and behavior.  Along the way we’ll meet the supporting cast of non-dino neighbors that live alongside dinosaurs within their Mesozoic ecosystems. We’ll examine the dramatic diversification and astounding ecological success of dinosaurs, and investigate theories for their sudden disappearance 66 million years ago.

 Lights, camera, ACTION! Geologists think planet Earth is incredibly exciting, but nowhere is the story of the behavior of our planet more dramatized and misrepresented than in movies! Whether they are big-budget thrillers like Jurassic Park, San Andreas, or The Day After Tomorrow, or low-brow science fiction like Boa, movies tend to stretch the reality of natural hazards and earth processes to great dramatic effect. In this course, we will have the opportunity to watch a variety of movie clips that focus on geologic hazards (such as volcanoes, earthquakes, avalanches, floods, and tsunamis) and other earth processes (origins of life, evolution, mass extinction, climate change, and glaciers). We will examine the scientific features and processes depicted in films, learn about their scientific basis, and critique the film’s portrayal of earth process. Students will work in groups to examine a film centered on a geological process, and critique the way science is depicted. The final project gives you the opportunity to develop your own script for a movie that does the geology correctly. This course will cover quantitative concepts relevant to earth processes, such as describing the world quantitatively, understanding uncertainty and risk, and evaluating quality and sources of data.Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsGeneral Education Requirements:Quantitative Thinking Q3Course Materials:GEOL 103-01

 Volcanic eruptions are the awe-inspiring expression of a planet’s internal dynamics. They supply the source materials for scientific studies of rocky planets, inspire works of art and literature, feature prominently in sacred traditions, and provide some of the most fertile ground on Earth. They are also destructive and agonizingly uncertain in duration, wreaking havoc on local to global scales via clouds of ash, lava flows, and secondary hazards (e.g., mudflows, famine). This course will cover volcanoes broadly: where and why they occur; what drives eruptions; monitoring; impacts; hazard mitigation; “reading the rocks”; volcanoes in art and culture; and perspectives from local populations.

Course Details:
 Hydrology is the study of physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur as water interacts with the earth. In this course we will focus on the near-surface cycling of water and the physical processes that drive this motion. We will discuss the dynamics of water as it flows across the surface of the landscape, moves through channels, and passes into the shallow subsurface. Open channel flow, hydrographs, floods, and arid region water scarcity will be the focus of the first portion of the course. The bulk of the course will look at the flow of water through permeable, saturated media, heterogeneity of flow, and several equations used to describe flow dynamics in aquifers. Flow through fractured and karst systems will be discussed. Importantly, we will spend time on the methods used by scientists and engineers (and consultants!) to understand the details and timescales of groundwater flow: wells, slug tests, pump tests, and geochemistry. Contaminant transport via groundwater flow will be examined in case studies. The use of quantitative tools such as calculations, numerical modeling, and estimation will be used to better understand the dynamics of water transport on our planet. Prerequisite(s): Any 100-level geology lab course.Distribution Requirements:Natural science and mathematicsGeneral Education Requirements:Quantitative Thinking Q1Course Materials:GEOL 303-01

 All readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) has been called the "savage anomaly" of the Enlightenment because his philosophy enables an alternative or ’hidden’ modernity based on the interdependence of beings rather than their hierarchy. Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature-as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous "imperium" in, yet above, nature-and of society as a continuation of nature-as opposed to the dominant theories of the "social contract" that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the "political" and the "environment." Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:GERM 274-01

Course Details:
 For Marx, "private capital" is an oxymoron - a contradiction in terms, since by its very nature capital is social. And "philosophy" is really not a thing, at least not the way it’s always been defined, since the world of ideas has no existence independent of the material conditions of human existence. In this course, we will try to recover the revolutionary force of these arguments with a focus on what they show us about the illusory or fantastic character of modern life. From the early critique of alienation to the late analysis of surplus value, Marx showed over and again how the so-called rational world is not as rational as it seems: specters, fetishes, deceptive appearances, "false consciousness" are just some of the features of life under capital that Marx exposes and that continue to haunt our world (just think of how we appeal to the "magic of the market," its "invisible hand" or to "creative destruction"). We will read selections from Marx’s early writings on religion and alienation through the theory of ideology, of commodity fetishism, and of primitive accumulation to his late programmatic texts in tandem with texts by 20th-century thinkers who critiqued and further developed Marx’s thought (Lukacs, Gramsci, Lefort, Derrida).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:GERM 316-01

 For Marx, "private capital" is an oxymoron - a contradiction in terms, since by its very nature capital is social. And "philosophy" is really not a thing, at least not the way it’s always been defined, since the world of ideas has no existence independent of the material conditions of human existence.

This course approaches Kafka’s work both as a case for literary analysis and as one that offers insights into modernism. In one way or another, Kafka sheds light on massive industrialization, bureaucratization, the commodification of art, the destabilization of patriarchy, and the development of technology and media, as well as on the question: what is literature itself. In addition to a selection of Kafka’s fiction, we shall read Crumb and Mairowitz’s graphic version of Kafka’s life and work, allowing students to produce their own graphic group project.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:GERM 365-01

 Rather than approaching the history of Europe in wartime solely through the lens of military history or the history of international relations, this course will also delve into European culture, politics, and society in the period 1914-1945 and will explore the ways that both world wars profoundly changed the lives of Europeans living at the time, as well as the landscape of Europe itself. We will take a peripatetic approach, diving into different themes in different places and times. We will explore, for example, the lives of a young British nurse and a young German soldier during the First World War. We will grapple with the experiences of a concentration camp survivor during the Holocaust. We will think about the ways that critics of empire drew on the experiences of fascism in the twentieth century to build their case against colonialism. And finally, using more contemporary accounts and news coverage, we will consider the legacies of these two transformative wars and think about how they shape our conceptions of Europe and Europeans today. The class will strongly emphasize the development of research and writing skills.

 This advanced course is required for majors. It examines the various forms of analysis used by historians through a study of different kinds of historical texts and sources. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the skills and habits of thinking essential to practicing the discipline of history. This course invites students to address some of the myriad questions and controversies that surround such historical concepts as "objectivity," "subjectivity," "truth," "epistemology," and thereby to develop a "philosophy" of history.

 This advanced course is required for majors. It examines the various forms of analysis used by historians through a study of different kinds of historical texts and sources. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the skills and habits of thinking essential to practicing the discipline of history. This course invites students to address some of the myriad questions and controversies that surround such historical concepts as "objectivity," "subjectivity," "truth," "epistemology," and thereby to develop a "philosophy" of history. At the same time, it stresses the acquisition of such historical tools as the use of written, oral, computer and media sources and the development of analytical writing skills.

 A history of feminism and feminist thought in the United States between 1848-2022, this course focuses on women’s rights: the ideologies, leaders, and actions that forced change in long-held gender roles and patriarchal governing norms. We will also interrogate the myths, hypocrisies, and the backlash moments that are central to United States history, culture, and politics in the context of women’s rights. Critical to our course is learning about the many divergent ways that ethnicity, race, sexuality, and class came to inform how we understand feminism and its history to the present day.

 From the first glance at a digital clock in the morning to putting events in a Google calendar, humans interact with the concept of time on a daily basis. We are so accustomed to living within familiar temporal frameworks that we rarely notice how our lives are governed by “time.” But a universally agreed upon standard for “time” has not always existed and, indeed, has shifted across human history. How and why was time invented? How has time in its various forms been constructed over the course of the past several centuries in different parts of the world? How is power inscribed in our conception of time?  How are conceptualizations of temporal universality (and even physicists’ theories of relativity) bound up with global trade and even something as prosaic as shipping timetables?
In this course, we will discuss why humans need “time” and how culturally specific definitions of "time" have impacted global history.  While we will criss-cross millenia of temporal imaginaries, our emphasis will be upon "modern times" starting with the first globalization of the 16th century. We will trace ’time’ history through the present, both within the establishment of colonial and industrial manipulations of temporality as well as the coeval persistence of alternative temporalities as activations of political, cultural, and epistemic resistance.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:HIST 294-04

 Is caste a long-standing social structure or a recent construct? Does it belong to the past or continue to shape lives today? Is it unique to Hindus in South Asia, or does it have a global impact? In this course, we will delve into the intricacies of caste as a social practice. We’ll analyze the historical development of caste and its interactions with other hierarchies, such as race, gender, and sexuality, not only in South Asia but around the world. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize how caste transcends geographical boundaries, examining its portrayal in diverse sources such as literature, ethnographies, censuses, and legal documents. We will also closely examine the histories and lasting effects of anti-caste movements. Our exploration begins in the 19th century when colonialism reshaped caste dynamics while also providing opportunities for marginalized communities to challenge established power structures. Additionally, we will investigate the emergence of caste practices within Afro-Caribbean diaspora communities. Lastly, we will explore the contemporary dimensions of caste, considering how it influences social mobility and marginalization within the context of global migration and social movements. In essence, this course will equip you with fresh perspectives on caste, with an emphasis on primary sources.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:HIST 294-05

The most momentous movements were led by subjugated peoples, including enslaved Africans and white workers. This course examines the practices that revolutionaries like Nanny of the Maroons, Samuel Adams, and Toussaint L’Overture deployed; how political thought, spiritual beliefs, food diplomacy, and ecological transformation guided actions; and how exiles, refugees, and forcibly transported persons re-shaped the wider Atlantic World from the New Orleans and Cuba to Sierra Leone and London. The course culminates with an in-depth discussion of the revolution in Haiti and its repercussions for the wider Caribbean, North America, and Europe along with an examination of the way this historical event has been commemorated in public history and popular culture up to the present.

 Much about mainstream narratives of gender transgression are determined by powerful, cis-dominated institutions, still even to this day: the media, schools, police, the law, doctors and psychiatrists. These are institutions structured by a racialized, heteronormative gender binary, and for whom trans people pose a problem to be managed. Oral history offers the possibility for trans people to tell their own stories, and, in doing so, give more nuanced, complex analysis of identity, activism, and of the intersectional operations of systems of power. Oral history also makes room for the complex interplay of joy, playfulness, grief, anxiety, and connection that makes queer and trans life so valuable. In this project-based and community engaged course, students will have hands on experience working with an archive of queer and trans oral histories in the context of the pandemic and uprisings for racial justice. Working closely with our community partner, the Tretter Transgender Oral History Project, we will learn about oral history methodology and interview techniques, and then have the opportunity to conduct oral history interviews, develop audio or video projects using extant oral histories, and contribute to an online archive of queer and trans oral history.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:HIST 305-01

 In the minds of many Americans, cities are places where nature is absent-places where nature exists only in the crevices and on the margins of spaces dominated by technology, concrete, and human artifice. This course confronts this assumption directly, drawing on the scholarship from the relatively young field of urban environmental history to uncover the deep interconnections between urban America and the natural world. Among the other things, we will examine how society has drawn upon nature to build and sustain urban growth, the implications that urban growth has for transforming ecosystems both local and distant, and how social values have guided urbanites as they have built and rearranged the world around them. Using the Twin Cities has a backdrop and constant reference point, we will attempt to understand the constantly changing ways that people, cities, and nature have shaped and reshaped one another throughout American history.

 What is an artists’ book? Are they works of art that belong on display, or should they be "read" in a library? Using Macalester’s artists’ book collection as the foundation for exploration, we will study the forms and functions of these works. Starting in the 1950s and continuing to the present, this course will consider how this genre was formed and what influences it. We will review selected artists’ books, survey popular book types, and briefly discuss the genre’s obsession with terminology. In considering artists’ books, we will focus on such questions as these: Why is it a book? Why this medium? How is it a book? We will discuss artistic strategies and techniques as we consider how to determine if a book is successful or not.  We will explore basic book-making techniques using traditional and modern forms, culminating in a final book project in which students synthesize their knowledge of materials and form by making their own book. The course covers content development, object design, integration of various media, digital and low-tech image making processes, and the functionality of various bookmaking materials, culminating in an exhibit of the completed artists’ books.Course Materials:INTD 130-01

The course covers content development, object design, integration of various media, digital and low-tech image making processes, and the functionality of various bookmaking materials, culminating in an exhibit of the completed artists’ books.

 Are you concerned about an environmental or social problem that you see in your community? Then this course is for you! Using a design thinking methodology, this course will guide participants through the hands-on experience of developing innovative interventions aimed at addressing problems in their community. Using the Macalester campus and the neighboring community as a living laboratory, students will combine theory and practice while working collaboratively to build ideas that are compelling, impactful and realizable. During the course of the semester, student teams will define a problem, identify and evaluate solutions, and develop, pilot and pitch implementation plans. Through collaborative activities, workshopping sessions and participatory lectures, students will practice empathy and systems-thinking and build skills that promote creative thinking, collaboration, negotiation and taking action. This course will involve group work and require participants to be highly interactive and share creative ideas in order to develop practical approaches to addressing real-world problems. The goal of this course is to help future leaders hone the skills they need to craft effective solutions for environmental and/or social challenges to create holistic approaches and integrated solutions.Course Materials:INTD 192-01

 Should you remove your shoes when entering a building? Can a liquid made from oats be called milk? What should the proportion between a head and torso be in a sculpture? Whether they take the forms of models, algorithms, or laws, rules permeate nearly all spheres of human life. In this seminar, we will focus on Lorraine Daston’s recent book Rules: A Short History of What We Live By. Daston takes readers through long stretches of history to examine not only the varied forms of rules, but also what we can learn by thinking through this history. When do detailed, prescriptive rules work better than vague ones? How do rules change? Throughout the course, we will consider the larger question: what lessons for our work and lives can we take by thinking through the design, moral, and other problems of rules? First priority for registration is for declared concentrators in Legal Studies. The course will not fulfill one of the six required courses for the concentration. The book will be provided to all students.  First seven weeks of the semester only (course finishes at Spring Break).Course Materials:INTD 291-01

While media are central to the continued production of a sense of "the world" at large or the "global" scale, media industries are situated geographically, culturally and institutionally. Even if they promise worldwide coverage or are multinational companies, there is much to be gained from studying how media are produced and distributed differently according to specific social, political, economic and historical conditions.

Infrastructure is a site where hopes and dreams are invested. It is also a place where unequal influence is laid bare. In this course we will consider infrastructure’s technical politics, tracing water pipes and railway networks; interstate highways and fiber-optic lines.

 This course examines the relationship between cultural and political change during three very different revolutions: France 1789, Russia 1917, Iran 1979. How do people change when governments are overturned? How do revolutions shape popular consciousness? Do people understand events as revolutionaries intend? To answer these questions, we will examine symbols and political ideologies, mass media, education, social identities, the culture of violence, popular participation and resistance, and other issues. Readings will include revolution-inspiring works of Voltaire and Rousseau, Marx and Lenin, Khomeini and the Koran. We will read sympathetic and antagonistic contemporary accounts, and look at popular culture to see how events were understood. Fashion and etiquette, comics and caricatures, movies and plays will be used.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:INTL 364-01

 Capitalism, for many, is synonymous with the "natural" exchange of goods and services through "the free market." But fuller examination shows capitalism to be neither natural, free, nor limited to economic transactions. Capitalism more precisely is a historical social system and a way of being which now penetrates all forms of life: cultural, ecological, civic and more. This senior seminar aims to identify capitalism’s origins and development, and interrogate its contemporary status. Thinkers such as Smith, Marx, and Braudel will loom, but readings will focus on works by Beaud, Weber, Tawney, Kotz, Wallerstein, and others. The course concludes with a significant research paper on a topic, relevant to the theme, of a student’s choice.

 The sense of being out of place in one’s society or one’s nation, estranged from one’s self or the world - this is the feeling that has motivated many of the narratives of modern Japanese fiction. Through stories of precocious adolescents, outcast minorities, vagabond women, disillusioned soldiers, and rebellious youth, this course examines the social implications of narrative fiction (including film, anime, and manga) within the context of modern Japanese history. While introducing methods of literary analysis and developing a familiarity with major works of Japanese fiction, the course aims to cultivate an understanding of how stories can be used to engage and think about the quandaries of modern society. We will explore the way these narratives express marginal experiences, rethink the foundations of human and societal bonds, and articulate new ways of being in the world. Works covered include stories by Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Mishima Yukio, and Murakami Haruki, as well as films by Akira Kurosawa, Koreeda Hirokazu, and Otomo Katsuhiro.

It aims to give students not only a facility and sophistication in translating Japanese, but also a closer familiarity with the Japanese language itself. Through weekly translation assignments, we will examine the expressive qualities of the Japanese language, tracing major developments of prose style in the modern period and studying the socio-historical context manifested in those linguistic innovations. Our work will be informed and enhanced by engagements with theories of translation as well as essays on Japanese-to-English translation specifically. We will cover a broad range of genres, including essays, poetry, manga, and film (subtitles). The course will culminate in an original project translating a Japanese work of one’s choice.

 The Neotropical realm refers to the biogeographic region that includes the tropical terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and South America’s temperate zone. These areas provide a range of services-both locally and globally--including water sources, climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. They are also home to various human populations and support the livelihood of local and global human populations. This course provides students a basic understanding of the most important biophysical and social characteristics of the dominant landscapes of the Neotropics. Among others, these include tropical rain forests, Andean páramos, tropical dry forests, wetlands, deserts and temperate forests of southern South America. For each of these landscapes, we will analyze the key climatological, biogeographical and ecological processes and also study the peoples that live in them including indigenous communities, afro-descendants, and mestizos. Finally, using examples of these areas, we also analyze human-environment interactions including land change processes, biodiversity, resource and cultural conservation, and climate change impacts.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:LATI 239-01

Course Details:
 This course focuses on reproductive health as a human right following the reproductive justice framework. It will focus on women and how they navigate the system to expand their rights. The course will pay particular attention to women who are marginalized due to their race, class, gender identity, indigeneity, and religion. In doing so, this course studies reproductive health and human rights in relation to the broader structural context in the Americas (e.g. national laws and international conventions). As the topic of women’s reproductive rights is vast, we will be focusing on abortion, domestic violence, and motherhood. Students in the class will study these issues from the perspective of women’s organizations that have mobilized to expand reproductive rights. This course will be comparative in nature as it will focus on reproductive rights in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1980s onwards. These two regions are intimately connected politically and economically, and in regards to reproductive rights. For example, the gag rule introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 jeopardized the reproductive health services provided in Latin American countries that received funding from the U.S. government. Yet another way that these two regions have been coupled is through feminist networks that have been working to expand reproductive rights in the Americas.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:LATI 248-01

Course Details:
 This course examines and critically analyzes various approaches to the study of how different individuals and communities in particular historical and cultural scenarios in contemporary Latin America create meanings about their past experience with political violence. The course addresses questions related to the tension between remembering and forgetting, the presence of conflicting memories and truths and how these are negotiated or not through distinct forms of representation. The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling. Finally, the course will also compel students to think about what consequences the politics of memory in postwar Latin America. The content and discussion in this course will necessarily engage with historical contexts and personal testimonies of violence that include arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual violence, genocide, massacres, extrajudicial execution and disappearances. Much of the material will be emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with. We will do our best to flag especially graphic or intense content that discusses or represents violence and will do our best to make this classroom a space where we can engage bravely, empathetically and thoughtfully with difficult content every week.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:LATI 251-01

Finally, the course will also compel students to think about what consequences the politics of memory in postwar Latin America. The content and discussion in this course will necessarily engage with historical contexts and personal testimonies of violence that include arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual violence, genocide, massacres, extrajudicial execution and disappearances. Much of the material will be emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with. We will do our best to flag especially graphic or intense content that discusses or represents violence and will do our best to make this classroom a space where we can engage bravely, empathetically and thoughtfully with difficult content every week.

 Long before the advent of television and other screen media, theater and dramatic performances were a means of presenting and debating the pressing socio-historical issues of the day through the vehicle of fiction. They were also an instrument for religious and political propaganda to create and maintain social cohesion, and even justify the very existence of social values, political authority, colonization, and social hierarchies (i.e. subjugation). In this course, we will study a selection of dramatic performances and theatrical plays written about Latin America on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Our selected list of works includes texts produced by indigenous communities before the arrival of Columbus (1492) as well as theatrical plays written by Latin American and Spanish playwrights during the first two hundred years of the colonial domination in Latin America (15th and 16th centuries), also known as Spain’s Golden Age.

 The aim of this course is to make you aware of the complex organization and systematic nature of language, the primary means of human communication. In a sense, you will be studying yourself, since you are a prime example of a language user. Most of your knowledge of language, however, is unconscious, and the part of language that you can describe is largely the result of your earlier education, which may have given you confused, confusing, or misleading notions about language. This course is intended to clarify your ideas about language and bring you to a better understanding of its nature. By the end of the course you should be familiar with some of the terminology and techniques of linguistic analysis and be able to apply this knowledge to the description of different languages. There are no prerequisites, but this course is the prerequisite for almost every higher level course within the linguistics major.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:LING 100-01

 Sociolinguistics is the study of the social language variation inevitable in all societies, be they closed and uniform or diverse and multicultural. Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture. As humans, we judge each other constantly on the basis of the way we use language, we make sweeping generalizations about people’s values and moral worth solely on the basis of the language they use.  Diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. If someone criticizes our language we feel they are criticizing our inmost self. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who communicate differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:LING 175-01

 Human beings have an unprecedented ability to shape the environment around them, yet the environment powerfully shapes both individuals and species. Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we’ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we’ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we’ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we’ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them. Knowing what makes a healthy language, we’ll look at endangered languages and the connections between linguistic diversity and biodiversity.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:LING 225-01

 In this course students analyze the social, cultural, economic, political, and regulatory factors shaping the nature of US communications media, and then investigate how this affects local media organizations and their role in recognizing, serving and facilitating (or not) local populations, communities, interaction, identity, and civic engagement. Considering the history and practices of American journalism, and the current shifts in media technology and economics, the class examines the degree to which media function to provide effective access to news and information, foster diversity of content, encourage civic engagement, and serve the interest of citizens and diverse communities in a democratic society. Individual student projects for the course begin by identifying particular geographic, ethnic, or cultural neighborhoods and communities in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, and proceed to explore the degree to which these communities are recognized, defined, or served by various media institutions and journalism practice. Students explore various attempts to revitalize local communication, news delivery and civic discourse through experiments in community media, citizen journalism, community-based news aggregation, media arts, community service and other media innovations and reforms across neighborhood, ethnic, immigrant, gender, sexuality, and other public issues and community participation.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:MCST 126-01

While media are central to the continued production of a sense of "the world" at large or the "global" scale, media industries are situated geographically, culturally and institutionally.  Even if they promise worldwide coverage or are multinational companies, there is much to be gained from studying how media are produced and distributed differently according to specific social, political, economic and historical conditions.

 This course is designed as a basic introduction to digital video production. The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsCourse Materials:MCST 232-01

We will take time to appreciate the entertainment value and athleticism that Bruce Lee brought to his work, but we will also learn to distinguish the commercialized, commodified Bruce Lee (from t-shirts to posters to action figures) from the serious historical figure who symbolized the spirit of cultural independence and political sovereignty around the world.

 We are living through another wave of popular interest in “cults” and “cultists,” manifesting in true crime podcasts (Escaping NXIVM, Heaven’s Gate), television documentaries (Wild Wild Country, The Deep End), fictional horror or thriller stories (Midsommar, The Idol, Martha Marcy May Marlene), and historical dramatizations (Waco, The Master). These cultural works use the “cult” designation (with all its connotations and associated narratives) to label and make sense of a range of religious, political, economic, and social practices, ideas, and organizations, both contemporary and historical. This course aims to look critically at these media texts and the larger popular fascination with “cults.” In analyzing these narratives about religion, power, charisma, and commitment, we will not primarily focus on the so-called “cultists” being represented, but on the audiences that consume and interpret the stories and the cultural contexts that give rise to them. Looking closely at these images and narratives can reveal popular anxieties and ways of thinking about power and agency, identity and subjectivity, spirituality and secularism, and individuality and collectivity, for instance. Importantly, many of these historical and contemporary treatments also act as powerful sites for working out ideas about race, gender, and sexuality. Our approach will be theoretical and analytical as we examine key historical case studies from the second half of the 20th century (including media engagements with People’s Temple, the Black liberation group MOVE, and the Branch Davidians) and more contemporary examples (including MLM and crypto groups, NXIVM, and Teal Swan).Course Materials:MCST 294-01

 Cultural heritage sites, including libraries, archives and museums, have existed in some shape or form for a very long time. Computers, on the other hand, have only been a part of these institutions for about sixty years. Although technologies offer more efficient and cost-effective ways to store and disseminate information and promise greater accessibility to materials, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they successfully facilitate the missions of these cultural heritage sites or the needs of their visitors. Why is this the case? Do digital technologies truly have the potential to decentralize and democratize these spaces? What can they tell us about what we value, as a culture? In this interdisciplinary course, we will reflect on the impact of digital technologies on cultural heritage sites, and museums in particular, starting in the 1960s and continuing through the present, including discussion of how museums responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, students will learn how to collect, curate, and digitize objects, write and design an object label, and contribute to an online exhibition.

 The concept of freedom both lies at the heart of human rights discourse and provides the spark that ignites any number of musical movements. Intended for students with strong interests in the intersection between the performing arts and humanities, this course serves as an introduction both to the concept of freedom as it developed in Western societies since the late eighteenth century and to the history of music in the cultures that have fostered such ideals. It intends to introduce students to the study of music (and, by association, arts in general) from social, cultural, and critical perspectives, using the framework of freedom as a common theme. It also aims to contextualize the discourse of human rights within the history of arts and ideas, providing students with a a sense of the term’s changing meanings and emphases over time and across space. We will explore traditions in both Western art music (also known as "classical music") and the American popular (recorded) music in a search for ways in which music has served social-political ideologies - overtly through the aims of its composers and performers, and unintentionally through the conditions of its reception. Historical readings on the concept of freedom from a variety of disciplinary perspectives (history, philosophy, political science, critical theory) will introduce students to several of the most influential thinkers on the subject and the central concerns and questions that animate the discourse on freedom. No prior background in music is required for the course, although it is assumed that students will have a true interest not only in popular music of the twentieth century but also other traditions and genres, such as opera and symphonic music. "Freedom" signifies a number of ideals, which operate in real-political and abstract-aesthetic realms. Music can represent, convey, and "mean" freedom in infinite ways, and it is the intention of this course to introduce students to this diversity.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:MUSI 155-01

Course Details:
 This course is designed primarily for music majors, music minors, and students with previous music background. We study the organization of musical sounds in selected traditions across the world through the development of analytical skills. Music theory is approached here "not as a codification of Western harmonic practice, but as symbolic systems for conveying musical knowledge" (Roeder 2011). Course materials also examine the discourse of "world music" against the changing ideas of musical otherness. The ability to read staff notation is preferred.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:MUSI 211-01

Course Details:
 This course explores music of the European nineteenth century from two perspectives that together define the era. Romanticism is an aesthetic orientation that pits itself against Enlightenment and Classicism. Unlike the refined music of the eighteenth century, Romantic music (piano music, operas, even symphonies) sold itself to bourgeois audiences as wild, tuned to the supernatural, the transcendent, touched by madness, intoxicated by drugs, obsessed with sex. Meanwhile, these same cultural consumers, the bourgeoisie, were driven to identify themselves as national subjects, citizens of unique and independent cultural and political nations. National music sold itself as an expression of the spirit of a language community. In class, guided by listening and reading assignments, we will discuss the ways in which these two framing ideas shaped musical composition, performance, and audience listening habits, leading to changes in the way music was discussed in philosophical and political discourse. Prerequisite(s): MUSI 113 or permission of instructor.Distribution Requirements:Fine artsGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:MUSI 343-01

Or how about the suffering of people who are really far away from me-say, on another continent? Is it okay for me to spend money on cool stuff for myself when instead I could donate it to help people who are suffering very badly far away?  If things in life other than pleasure matter too, what are they? People who oppose torture think that it’s wrong to hurt one person really badly even in order to prevent a large number of people from being hurt.  Are they right?  Is it always wrong to treat someone as merely a means to an end? Is it in general wrong to do things to people without their consent?  Why?  When do people deserve to be praised or blamed for their actions? What kind of person should I be?  Should I try to be happy? Or should I try to be virtuous? Is virtue its own reward? Or are we all inevitably faced with a choice between being virtuous and being happy?  If we are faced with that choice, which one should we pick?  In Ethics, we will talk about these questions, and others.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:PHIL 121-02

 For Marx, "private capital" is an oxymoron - a contradiction in terms, since by its very nature capital is social. And "philosophy" is really not a thing, at least not the way it’s always been defined, since the world of ideas has no existence independent of the material conditions of human existence. In this course, we will try to recover the revolutionary force of these arguments with a focus on what they show us about the illusory or fantastic character of modern life. From the early critique of alienation to the late analysis of surplus value, Marx showed over and again how the so-called rational world is not as rational as it seems: specters, fetishes, deceptive appearances, "false consciousness" are just some of the features of life under capital that Marx exposes and that continue to haunt our world (just think of how we appeal to the "magic of the market," its "invisible hand" or to "creative destruction"). We will read selections from Marx’s early writings on religion and alienation through the theory of ideology, of commodity fetishism, and of primitive accumulation to his late programmatic texts in tandem with texts by 20th-century thinkers who critiqued and further developed Marx’s thought (Lukacs, Gramsci, Lefort, Derrida).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:PHIL 216-01

We will read selections from Marx’s early writings on religion and alienation through the theory of ideology, of commodity fetishism, and of primitive accumulation to his late programmatic texts in tandem with texts by 20th-century thinkers who critiqued and further developed Marx’s thought (Lukacs, Gramsci, Lefort, Derrida).

 This class addresses conceptual and ethical questions at the foundation of the study of sexism, racism, heterosexism, and transphobia. Many of us believe, for example, that race and gender are both socially constructed. But what exactly is social construction?  Would there be room for races and genders in a perfectly just society, or are races and genders intrinsically oppressive categories that should be eliminated?  Nowadays we are taught to distinguish gender from sex. But what is sex? Is sex socially constructed, like gender, or is it a strictly biological phenomenon?  Population geneticists have recently argued that, surprisingly, race is biological after all. Are their arguments convincing, or flawed?  How can thinking carefully about gender and sex problematize our ordinary understanding of sexual orientation? In our unjust society, when if ever does it make sense to respond to racial injustice with affirmative action? Is sex-selective abortion immoral? If you think it is, can you still be pro-choice? What should we think about affirmative action?  We will address these questions, and others, by drawing on recent work at the intersection of philosophy, social science, and biology. Authors to be studied include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Sally Haslanger, Kate Manne, Debra Satz, Tommie Shelby, Quayshawn Spencer, and Laurence Thomas.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:PHIL 218-01

 Emerging in the 1970s, the field of environmental ethics began by sparking a rich line of philosophical inquiry largely focused on the moral status of the natural world and the non-human entities within it. What reasons do we have to give moral consideration to the environment? And what do we mean when we say we have a moral duty toward the environment? Do we have moral duties to individuals within a species, or to species themselves, or to ecosystems, or to...? This course will invite you to reflect on key philosophical works that engage these and related questions. You will also have the opportunity to think about significant emerging topics in environmental ethics.

 What is language and what is it for? What makes a series of sounds into a meaningful sentence? What makes a sentence true? Why is language always changing? This course will introduce students to ways in which twentieth century philosophers have attempted to provide answers to such questions. Since the philosophy of language has been so crucial to contemporary philosophy, this course also serves as an introduction to philosophical thought from the beginning of twentieth century to the present. Topics will range from more technical problems (theories of meaning, reference and truth; synonymy and analyticity; universals and natural kinds; private languages) to broader issues examining the relationship between language and culture (language games; radical interpretation; social change). Readings typically include writings by Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V. Quine, John Searle, Donald Davidson, Richard Rorty, Michel Foucault, and bell hooks.

Course Details:
 This course introduces students to coding and computational methods, focusing on developing computation-based skills that are critical for practicing physicists. Students process experimental data using statistical tools, study the implications of realistic physical models using a toolbox of numerical methods, and visualize information in meaningful formats.The course starts with an introduction to coding (in Python) and a survey of data manipulation tools (e.g., reading, writing, analyzing statistically, etc.). The focus is on skills that help students in labs, research, and anywhere else they need to extract physical insight from data. After the introduction to data analysis, the course transitions into a survey of numerical techniques which facilitate quantitative analysis of theoretical models describing complex physical phenomena, thereby creating a bridge between experimental/observational and theoretical physics.The lab provides hands-on experience in the application of computational skills discussed in lecture to realistic physical models drawn from a wide range of physics subdisciplines. Projects in the lab are implemented using Jupyter notebooks, via the Google Colaboratory environment. Students write documentation in Latex and Markdown. No previous experience with any of these is assumed. Prerequisite(s): PHYS 331Course Materials:PHYS 370-01

 This course has three broad goals. The first is to develop the foundational knowledge and conceptual literacy necessary to engage with International Relations’ multidimensional concerns. These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:POLI 120-01

 What does it mean to theorize "the political"? How does one undertake such an inquiry? What is the relationship between the political, the economic, the social, and the cultural? This course is designed to help students answer these questions and introduce them to the field of Political Theory. We will explore the work of some the most influential thinkers in the history of political thought – namely, Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Arendt. We will also engage contemporary scholarship in the discipline and try to understand where Political Theory is headed today. Significantly, this course will move beyond the scope of a traditional introductory survey and consider the ways in which Political Theory has historically ignored questions of racism, sexism, and colonialism. In an attempt to decolonize the canon, we will consider the ways in which these issues have been ignored despite the fact that they have lurked in the background of some of the most important texts in the history of political thought.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:POLI 160-01

These are commendable achievements. Yet, old quotidian urgencies such as precarious personal safety, hunger, poor health, and political disorder are still prevalent. This is the dialectic of development. This course explores these contradictions. Most of the attention will be given to the concepts of power, politics, and development in contemporary Africa.

The relationships among work, wealth and well-being are a perennial concern and have been central to the study of political economy, since its inception in the mid- to late-18th century. How does work produce wealth for the individual and for society? How, or when, does individual and social wealth translate into individual and/or social well-being? And, how does the character of work affect individual well-being or happiness? This course will examine the answers given to these questions (and myriad corollary questions) by writers within the political economy tradition.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:POLI 265-01

 This course deals with the liberal and conservative currents(s) running through the Western tradition of political thought from the time of the French Revolution to today.  Its main goal of to provide a solid introduction to these two bodies of philosophical speculation.  Through a close reading of texts and commentaries, we will critically (though empathetically) examine the relevant works of thinkers such as John Locke, Thomas Paine, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, John Henry Newman, Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr., Leo Strauss, John Dewey, Friedrich von Hayek, Irving Kristol, Michael Oakshott, and Alasdair MacIntyre.  The focus of our inquiries will be upon topics such as "how should I lead my life?" (ethics), and "how should we lead our lives together?" (politics). Important secondary goals of the course include: familiarizing students with the various "languages" or "idioms" of conservative and liberal political thought; helping students understand the great political debates between conservative and liberals; applying both conservative and liberal political frames/concepts to a range of contemporary "hot-button" social and political issues. As an intermediate-level offering, this course is designed primarily for Political Science majors and non-majors in cognate fields (such as Philosophy) who have some experience in the discipline.  The course has no pre-requisites, however, and is therefore suitable for all students seeking to satisfy an interest in liberal and conservative political thought.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:POLI 267-01

 All readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required. Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) has been called the "savage anomaly" of the Enlightenment because his philosophy enables an alternative or ’hidden’ modernity based on the interdependence of beings rather than their hierarchy. Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature-as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous "imperium" in, yet above, nature-and of society as a continuation of nature-as opposed to the dominant theories of the "social contract" that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the "political" and the "environment." Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:POLI 274-01

 In this class, reproductive justice will become a critical framework for both political theory and political action. As a theoretical framework, reproductive justice is a way of thinking about freedom and the rights to maintain bodily autonomy, to have children, to not have children and to parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities. Insofar as reproductive justice centers the politics of sex, we’ll begin this class thinking about sexual autonomy (including access to contraception, sex education, prevention and treatment for STIs, etc.). From there, we’ll move into U.S. histories of forced sterilization, the fight for access to safe and legal abortion and the risks of childbirth and infant mortality, especially for BIPOC people. These histories will bring us into an exploration of reproductive justice as a framework for political practice and as a social justice movement. It’s about the legal and political action that may limit or expand the scope of justice to include things that would make reproduction meaningfully free (e.g., access to health care and safe housing, a living wage, and decarceration). We’ll study these issues through legal cases, historical readings, political theory, ethics and personal narratives that put focus on reproductive justice in the U.S. This class requires your thoughtful participation both in writing and discussion.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:POLI 294-03

 Racism has been written into the United States’ laws and entrenched in its institutions for much of its history. Understanding how laws and race intersect to shape institutions is critical to any analysis on race. This course will be divided into two sections. In Section 1, we will examine how court cases and government actions have moved towards equality in six public policy areas: citizenship, education, voting, employment, housing, and marriage. In Section 2, we will learn about and apply the framework of Critical Race Theory to the public policy areas discussed in Section 1.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:POLI 294-04

This insight led Robinson to a theory of “racial capitalism” that has been taken up by several scholars across disciplines. Through this course, we will attempt to answer the following questions: What is racial capitalism? How do we understand its key components (racism and capitalism) and how do they relate to one other? Is the question of the relationship between racism and capitalism a historical one or a purely theoretical one? How have these concepts influenced contemporary political struggles? What role do slavery, property relations, prisons, and the police play in the reproduction of racial capitalism?Course Materials:POLI 394-01

 Neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system, is an inherently interdisciplinary field involving multiple levels of analysis. This course approaches the study of brain, mind, and behavior from systems-level and behavioral perspectives. Current issues are examined within an integrative framework that begins with a focus on neuroanatomy, functional neural circuits, and diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems. This lays the groundwork for later study of the neural substrates of motivated behaviors (e.g., eating, sex, sleep, drug use), learning, memory, emotion, as well as aspects of neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Research methods and tools of behavioral neuroscience are featured throughout the course, through careful examination of primary journal articles and through hands-on experiences in weekly laboratory sessions. Science is a methodical process, and we will approach topics in this course through that lens. Fulfills Group A requirement for the Psychology major.

 Each of us is a unique individual with distinct interests, abilities, and appearances. At the same time, we all have much in common-each of us started as just a single cell at conception, our brains and bodies developed in essentially the same sequence, and someday, we will all die. What are the general paths and stages of development? How do our unique qualities emerge? What role does our genetic material play in development? What role does our environment play? Is there a point at which some of our traits are "set," or do we retain the capacity to change throughout development? In this course, we will work to answer these questions and more. With a life-span approach, we will examine the theories and research that describe and explain our physical, cognitive, and social development from conception to death.

 Mental health and wellbeing among school-aged youth in the US has been generally declining in recent decades, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and multiple social crises (eg, gun violence, hate crimes, political instability). How can teachers and school support services help prevent or reduce the negative effects on students’ mental health? How does the existing system of education contribute to emotional, behavioral, and mental problems among students and educators? How does this system add to disparities in educational outcomes among students who have been marginalized based on their identities? This course will examine both the educational systems and policies that affect preK-16 student mental health as well as individual-level practices that may intervene toward well-being. Throughout this course, students will engage with psychological theory, research, practical examples, and school-based mental health practitioners, including school psychologists, social workers, counselors, and special educators.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:PSYC 294-02

 For children to thrive in our increasingly diverse world, they must be prepared to engage with issues of race and racism. Children need to develop positive racial identities and learn how to navigate the racial privilege or discrimination that they will face in our society. Two of the best places for children to learn about race is from their parents and teachers, yet adults often struggle with this topic. Should we teach our children to be "colorblind," or should we teach them to notice race? When is the right age to start these conversations? For families and schools that are committed to equity and justice, how can we ensure that these values are passed on to our kids? In this class, we will draw from developmental, educational, social psychological, and social justice perspectives to generate answers to these questions and more. Counts toward the UP3 requirement.

 What is "disability" and what does an understanding of disability tell us about human experience more generally? What is a "disability identity" and what implications might claiming that identity have for psychological well-being and social change? How do stereotypes of disabled people and expectations of "normality" affect everyone’s lives (not just those with disabilities)? Why don’t many Deaf people consider themselves "disabled?" What might we learn from shifting the "problem" of disability from the individual person to the social environment? How do sexism, racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression influence how different bodies are viewed, treated, educated, and experienced? This course will explore questions that emerge from thinking about the experience of disability (and its intersection with identities based on gender, race, class, and sexuality). Our work together will be grounded in critical disability and Deaf studies frameworks that are themselves informed by and in conversation with feminist, queer, and critical race theories and perspectives. Through a consideration of the socially, culturally, linguistically, and historically constructed meanings of physical, sensory, and cognitive "impairments," the course will rely on theoretical and empirical readings from psychology and related disciplines, personal essays, film/video, and guest visitors as we explore the social and psychological meanings of disability.

 "Reward" is a concept with which most people are familiar: a hard-earned vacation at the end of a grueling work schedule, an A grade on a particularly challenging academic assignment, a good meal and a glass of wine after a long day’s work. However, this everyday usage of the term belies its complexity. In this course, we will explore “reward” from behavioral and neurobiological perspectives, often focusing on associative learning paradigms that allow for careful dissection of appetitive and consummatory behaviors. We will consider the underlying neural circuitry that enables individuals to learn about rewards and cues that signal these motivationally significant events. Our analysis will emphasize the similarities and distinctions between natural reward and drug reward. Prerequisites: PSYC 201 or STAT 155 and either PSYC 240 or PSYC 248.Course Materials:PSYC 394-02

This course will examine multiple frameworks of stress to understand how a broad array of stressful life experiences shape neural and behavioral development throughout different sensitive periods (including the prenatal, early childhood, and pubertal periods). We will apply resilience-science and insights from intervention- and prevention-research to understand how positive developmental outcomes can be promoted following experiences of early life stress. Specific topics will include stress neurobiology, environmental (re)calibration, attachment and social buffering, intergenerational mechanisms, and multi-system resilience. Class sessions will include a combination of student-led discussions and instruction in concepts from neuroendocrinology, developmental psychology, and developmental psychopathology. Prerequisites: PSYC 100; PSYC 201 or STAT 155; an intermediate course in Psychology.Course Materials:PSYC 394-05

 For nearly a thousand years, the religious lives of the ancient Israelites revolved around the Temple in Jerusalem. When the Romans destroyed the Temple in 70 CE, Jewish scribes needed to find new ways to carry on the worship and traditions of Judaism. This course introduces students to the rabbis and the literature they produced in the first several centuries of the common era. In our study of rabbinic texts such as the Mishnah, Midrash, and Talmud, we will see how the rabbis conceived Jewish thought and practice in Late Antiquity. In order to locate the rabbis in their historical context, we will also compare the classical rabbinic corpus with other Jewish texts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, Judeo-Hellenistic philosophy, and the New Testament. Since rabbinic Judaism stands as the foundation for Jewish praxis today, this course maintains a focus on how rabbis’ words and deeds continue to influence modern notions of Scripture, ethics, and theology.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:RELI 194-01

We will begin by looking at the formation of classical Islam in the Middle East, and looking at the classical Hindu epic, the Ramayana. From there we will move to a survey of the history of encounter and exchange, from the early period (al Biruni), to the establishment of the great Muslim sultanates. We will critically examine the evidence of religious conflict, alongside the evidence of rich cultural exchange, and interrogate the competing historigrahic narratives, according to which South Asia either become a single Indo-Islamic civilization or a place of two cultures destined to become different modern nation states (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh). Finally, we will consider colonial and post colonial South Asia and conclude with a reflection on the Babri Masjid crisis and India’s debates about secularism.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:InternationalismCourse Materials:RELI 233-01

 Asian Americans are often overlooked in the study of religion in the U.S., and yet the impact of Asian religious practices can be seen at every turn: yoga studios, mindfulness meditation, "zen" aesthetics of minimalism, and so on. What do we make of the gap between how Asian religions are practiced in Asian American communities and how these traditions have been reinterpreted by predominantly white, educated, middle class adherents? How do Asian American Christians negotiate their identities in the context of non-Asian Christian churches or the intergenerational tensions within their own ethnic churches? The approach of this course is interdisciplinary (and sometimes counterdisciplinary); it draws on theoretical and methodological insights from ethnic studies, religious studies, history, and sociology. Topics include: race and the racialization of Asian Americans; the politics of cultural and religious exchange; the commodification of Asian religious practices; and issues of assimilation and hybridity within Asian American Christian traditions.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:RELI 241-01

X was a man of many pieces, sometimes contradictory, that we explore through various representations: autobiographical, screenplay and film, hip hop music and culture, black international opinion, FBI surveillance documents, and a young adult novel co-written by his daughter Ilyasah Shabazz. To some extent, we will engage in a genre study. How does genre —autobiography, biography/history, fiction, hip hop and outlaw cultures —influence representation? How should we think about the continuities and discontinuities among historical, autobiographical, and fictional representations of Malcolm X? Questions we will explore include: Who is representing Malcolm, how and why? How are the various representations inflected by their respective media and genre? Why do we engage in myth-making? Can we distinguish Malcolm the man from Malcolm the myth? How does the religious studies category of “hagiography help us to understand some representations of Malcolm X? What are the perils of hagiography? Was Malcolm’s religion merely a prop for his politics? Assuming it was not, how do we do justice to the religious dimensions of his life? How does Malcolm X’s religious itinerary help us understand who he was? In the last third of the course, we explore Malcolm X as a revolutionary by comparing him with two contemporaries, Frantz Fanon, a revolutionary activist, anti-colonial theorist, and critic of antiblackness (1925-1961); and Amilcar Cabral, revolutionary poet and leader of the anticolonial struggle in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (1924-1973).

 In this course, students will explore how stories of past and present Christians and the theologies they produced contribute to the histories of gender and sexuality, particularly in the United States. We will pay special attention to the development of and intersections among queer theory, queer and trans activism, queer biblical interpretation, and queer theology in the U.S. from the late twentieth century on. Students will learn how the development of queer biblical interpretation and theology grew out of the intellectual and activist work of feminist, womanist, and mujerista scholars, theologians, ethicists, and pastors. In readings, class discussion, online forums, and written and creative work, students will be invited to explore the social construction of gendered identities and sexualities over time, from antiquity to the postmodern, and the intersections of these identities with religion, race, ethnicity, class, and dis/ability. Although the majority of the class will be devoted to scholarship and theological writing that insists on the inclusion of diverse sexualities and genders in the Christian past, present, and future, we will also examine the role that some forms of American Christianity play in the exclusion of LGBTQ+ people, the enforcement of compulsory heterosexuality, the “naturalization” of a gender binary, and the reification of patriarchal, racist, homophobic, and transphobic cultures.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:RELI 294-02

Special emphasis will be given to certain trends such as the foundation of monasteries, pilgrimage, icon and relic worship, and the emergence of Romanesque and Gothic styles in architecture, which changed the urban and rural topography of the continent.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:RELI 294-04

 We are living through another wave of popular interest in “cults” and “cultists,” manifesting in true crime podcasts (Escaping NXIVM, Heaven’s Gate), television documentaries (Wild Wild Country, The Deep End), fictional horror or thriller stories (Midsommar, The Idol, Martha Marcy May Marlene), and historical dramatizations (Waco, The Master). These cultural works use the “cult” designation (with all its connotations and associated narratives) to label and make sense of a range of religious, political, economic, and social practices, ideas, and organizations, both contemporary and historical. This course aims to look critically at these media texts and the larger popular fascination with “cults.” In analyzing these narratives about religion, power, charisma, and commitment, we will not primarily focus on the so-called “cultists” being represented, but on the audiences that consume and interpret the stories and the cultural contexts that give rise to them. Looking closely at these images and narratives can reveal popular anxieties and ways of thinking about power and agency, identity and subjectivity, spirituality and secularism, and individuality and collectivity, for instance. Importantly, many of these historical and contemporary treatments also act as powerful sites for working out ideas about race, gender, and sexuality. Our approach will be theoretical and analytical as we examine key historical case studies from the second half of the 20th century (including media engagements with People’s Temple, the Black liberation group MOVE, and the Branch Davidians) and more contemporary examples (including MLM and crypto groups, NXIVM, and Teal Swan).Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:RELI 294-05

 The word "ritual" is used in many contexts to refer to types of practice that are considered centrally important, as well as formalistic and repetitive. This seminar-style course concentrates on the concept of ritual as a central component of social practice, within and without religious groupings. Focusing on developing the concept of ritual, we will focus on ritual across traditions. This requires students to ’work with’ concepts - forming a conception of what they mean by ritual, and be willing to change that conception when faced with contradictory evidence.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Writing WACourse Materials:RELI 311-01

 This course explores how bodily practices of fasting and sexual abstinence have shaped Christian identities from the first century, C.E. to today. From Paul of Tarsus’ instructions about sexual discipline to the True Love Waits® campaign, from the desert fathers’ rigorous bodily regimens to the contemporary Christian diet movement, Christians have often understood the practice of renunciation as a necessary feature of spiritual perfection. In this course we will consider several ascetic movements in Christian history, including the development of ascetic practice in late antiquity, the rise of fasting practices among women in medieval Europe, and the culture of Christian dieting and chastity in the U.S. We will pay special attention to how Christian practices of piety both draw upon and contribute to cultural understandings of gender and the body.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:RELI 325-01

 From the first glance at a digital clock in the morning to putting events in a Google calendar, humans interact with the concept of time on a daily basis. We are so accustomed to living within familiar temporal frameworks that we rarely notice how our lives are governed by “time.” But a universally agreed upon standard for “time” has not always existed and, indeed, has shifted across human history. How and why was time invented? How has time in its various forms been constructed over the course of the past several centuries in different parts of the world? How is power inscribed in our conception of time?  How are conceptualizations of temporal universality (and even physicists’ theories of relativity) bound up with global trade and even something as prosaic as shipping timetables?
In this course, we will discuss why humans need “time” and how culturally specific definitions of "time" have impacted global history.  While we will criss-cross millenia of temporal imaginaries, our emphasis will be upon "modern times" starting with the first globalization of the 16th century. We will trace ’time’ history through the present, both within the establishment of colonial and industrial manipulations of temporality as well as the coeval persistence of alternative temporalities as activations of political, cultural, and epistemic resistance.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:RUSS 294-01

The profound political, social, economic, and cultural transformations that took place in Russia and Eastern Europe also had a significant impact on the artistic climate in China and Cuba. As the cultural imperatives of the communist state became radically redefined, the function of a work of art shifted from a conduit of propaganda to a vehicle for social change and political contestation. The course will also examine the motives of thinkers and leaders important for the spread of communism, including Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Castro, Che Guevara, and Mao. The course interrogates binaries of race and gender; democracy/authoritarianism; religion/secularism, and liberalism/conservatism— issues that are at the heart of current political debates worldwide.

How do people change when governments are overturned? How do revolutions shape the consciousness of their citizens? Do people understand events as revolutionaries intend them to? To answer these questions, we will examine symbols and political ideologies, mass media outreach, education and enlistment, changing social identities, the culture of violence, popular participation and resistance, as well as other issues. Readings will include such diverse sources as Voltaire and Rousseau, Marx and Lenin, Khomeini and the Koran. We will read contemporary accounts, both sympathetic and antagonistic, and look at popular culture to see how events were understood.

 The course introduces students to the sociological imagination, or "the quality of mind essential to grasp the interplay of individual and society, of biography and history, of self and the world," as C. Wright Mills described it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples’ lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:SOCI 110-01

 Sociolinguistics is the study of the social language variation inevitable in all societies, be they closed and uniform or diverse and multicultural. Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture. As humans, we judge each other constantly on the basis of the way we use language, we make sweeping generalizations about people’s values and moral worth solely on the basis of the language they use.  Diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. If someone criticizes our language we feel they are criticizing our inmost self. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who communicate differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:SOCI 175-01

 The use of imprisonment as a form of criminal punishment is only about as old at the United States. Currently, 1 in 100 adults in the United States are in prison or jail. How should we understand the growth of this form of criminal punishment? How is it similar to other methods to react to and to attempt to control unwanted behavior? What are the social consequences of these formal institutions of social control? In this course, we examine these developments in the processes and organization of social control, paying particular attention to criminal behavior and formal, legal responses to crime. We study and evaluate sociological theories of criminal behavior to understand how social forces influence levels of crimes. We examine recent criminal justice policies in the United States and their connections to inequality, examining the processes that account for expanding criminalization. Finally, we compare the development of formal, bureaucratic systems of social control and informal methods of social control, paying attention to the social and political implications of these developments.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:Quantitative Thinking Q2, U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:SOCI 190-01

 The course focuses on access to water as a case to learn about how racialized populations have been historically marginalized in the Twin Cities. In doing so, the class will study the ways Latinx women navigate and resist such marginalization in their role of caring for others in their families. Theoretically, we will engage with the concept of “environmental suffering” (Auyero and Swistun 2007) and extend it to analyze racial marginalization to analyze how racialization constrains Latinx women’s life chances, and of their families. The course will include two visits to Latinx neighborhoods to learn about local women’s stories. Also, we will partner with COPAL MN to learn about the experiences of current Latinx communities’ experiences regarding women’s water use. Specifically, we will support COPAL MN’s storytelling work in the Twin Cities. Thus, as part of their final project, students will complete an oral history project that will be part of the archive COPAL MN is compiling.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:SOCI 220-01

 This course focuses on reproductive health as a human right following the reproductive justice framework. It will focus on women and how they navigate the system to expand their rights. The course will pay particular attention to women who are marginalized due to their race, class, gender identity, indigeneity, and religion. In doing so, this course studies reproductive health and human rights in relation to the broader structural context in the Americas (e.g. national laws and international conventions). As the topic of women’s reproductive rights is vast, we will be focusing on abortion, domestic violence, and motherhood. Students in the class will study these issues from the perspective of women’s organizations that have mobilized to expand reproductive rights. This course will be comparative in nature as it will focus on reproductive rights in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1980s onwards. These two regions are intimately connected politically and economically, and in regards to reproductive rights. For example, the gag rule introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 jeopardized the reproductive health services provided in Latin American countries that received funding from the U.S. government. Yet another way that these two regions have been coupled is through feminist networks that have been working to expand reproductive rights in the Americas.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:SOCI 248-01

 This course is designed to engage students with the most sophisticated and useful schools of thought available in the social science disciplines. The course raises a number of questions: How can we best understand the complexities of self and society? Are these units of analysis useful in and of themselves? Are they contained in an essential body or polity that we can identify as some unitary entity called Jenny and John Doe, American, French, Arab/Jew, black/white, modern/primitive, developed/underdeveloped, Oriental/ Occidental, homo/heterosexual, male/female? Or are they socially produced units that have no essence in-of-themselves, produced and made real only through performance with the "Other"? Furthermore, is there something unique about modernity that has fundamentally transformed the notions of our selves, bodies, polities, races, and civilizations? If the answer to the last question is in the affirmative, how and why did this come to be the case, and what consequences does it hold for our understanding of the past and of the future? These are the kinds of questions that great figures in sociology have been asking since the nineteenth-century, including classic theorists like Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx, as well as more recent writers such as Ervin Goffman, Michel Foucault, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Edward Said.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:SOCI 272-01

 This is a team-taught class that combines sociology and anthropology decolonial theories to provide a critical examination of global perspectives which tend to be associated with modern institutions that emerge in the Global North. More importantly, through a decolonizing lens, we will delve into an alternative understanding of the global rooted in the perspective of the Global South and discuss its liberatory possibilities. To better grasp the “coloniality of power” (Quijano 2000) we will focus on how this is manifested in intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations and educational and arts institutions. The course will introduce students to subaltern practices and movements in the Global South that have the potential to unsettle the Western hegemony that dominates international organizations, and the fields of education and the arts in the Global North. A decolonial approach to global perspectives also requires an inquiry into the cultural and racial differences embedded in local-global contexts. Finally, the course will allow students to learn new ways of thinking about power, responsibility, and ethics in the context of globalization, and become aware of organizing experiences that have engaged in decolonization
processes. Students may write assignments in English or Spanish.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:SOCI 294-01

 Differently positioned groups and individuals in society experience and understand historical
occurrences from distinct vantage points. What becomes the accepted account of what has
transpired in our collective lives? How do we as a society remember and make sense of the past?  What types of knowledge get produced when only certain accounts of history make their way into official repositories? How is the past ordered and tamed in the service of maintaining systems of domination, exploitation, and perverse forms of inclusion? These questions orient us toward the study of “collective memory,” a concept coined by early sociologist Maurice Halbwachs in 1925 to refer to how memory becomes socially significant once taken up in a collective context. With a focus on placing the United States in global perspective, we will examine material such as video testimonies, museum displays, archival collections, public monuments, and news coverage to consider the relationship between power and knowledge, the place of history in contemporary political struggles, and the role of technology in historical preservation. Moreover, this course emphasizes how collective memory is also an ongoing project and practice that holds the capacity for transformative social change. Taking a community-engaged approach, we will close by considering the possible futures available to us if we reckon with the past and engage in critical-creative heritage practices in the present.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:SOCI 294-03

 Long before the advent of television and other screen media, theater and dramatic performances were a means of presenting and debating the pressing socio-historical issues of the day through the vehicle of fiction. They were also an instrument for religious and political propaganda to create and maintain social cohesion, and even justify the very existence of social values, political authority, colonization, and social hierarchies (i.e. subjugation). In this course, we will study a selection of dramatic performances and theatrical plays written about Latin America on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Our selected list of works includes texts produced by indigenous communities before the arrival of Columbus (1492) as well as theatrical plays written by Latin American and Spanish playwrights during the first two hundred years of the colonial domination in Latin America (15th and 16th centuries), also known as Spain’s Golden Age. This course satisfies the Area 1 requirement for the Spanish major. Prerequisite(s): SPAN 307 or consent of the instructor.Course Materials:SPAN 394-02

 From the sixteenth century to the twenty-first century, the Amazon rainforest has been a source of wonderment, greed, and, in our present, concern. However, as exemplified by metaphors such as “el Dorado”, the “Green Hell” or the “Lungs of the Earth”, the Amazon is as much a geographical space as it is a discursive formation.  This course offers an introduction to the cultural representations of the Amazon rainforest. From Indigenous myths to contemporary films and first-person accounts, we will analyze how the Amazon has been imagined and depicted by multiple actors, such as indigenous activists, scientists, filmmakers, and entrepreneurs. Through a variety of texts, disciplines, and voices, we will analyze how the Amazon has been narrated as a place of “origin”, “wealth”, “suffering”, and “resistance”. While students will gain a general understanding of Amazonian culture, one of the objectives of the course is to discuss how indigenous peoples are tapping into their ancestral knowledge to situate themselves as global political actors and fight back against environmental degradation. This course satisfies the Area 2 requirement of the Spanish major. Prerequisite: SPAN 307 or consent of the instructor.Course Materials:SPAN 394-03

 This class addresses conceptual and ethical questions at the foundation of the study of sexism, racism, heterosexism, and transphobia. Many of us believe, for example, that race and gender are both socially constructed. But what exactly is social construction?  Would there be room for races and genders in a perfectly just society, or are races and genders intrinsically oppressive categories that should be eliminated?  Nowadays we are taught to distinguish gender from sex. But what is sex? Is sex socially constructed, like gender, or is it a strictly biological phenomenon?  Population geneticists have recently argued that, surprisingly, race is biological after all. Are their arguments convincing, or flawed?  How can thinking carefully about gender and sex problematize our ordinary understanding of sexual orientation? In our unjust society, when if ever does it make sense to respond to racial injustice with affirmative action? Is sex-selective abortion immoral? If you think it is, can you still be pro-choice? What should we think about affirmative action? We will address these questions, and others, by drawing on recent work at the intersection of philosophy, social science, and biology. Authors to be studied include Elizabeth Anderson, Anthony Appiah, Sally Haslanger, Kate Manne, Debra Satz, Tommie Shelby, Quayshawn Spencer, and Laurence Thomas.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:WGSS 218-01

Prerequisite(s): This course focuses on reproductive health as a human right following the reproductive justice framework. It will focus on women and how they navigate the system to expand their rights. The course will pay particular attention to women who are marginalized due to their race, class, gender identity, indigeneity, and religion. In doing so, this course studies reproductive health and human rights in relation to the broader structural context in the Americas (e.g. national laws and international conventions). As the topic of women’s reproductive rights is vast, we will be focusing on abortion, domestic violence, and motherhood. Students in the class will study these issues from the perspective of women’s organizations that have mobilized to expand reproductive rights. This course will be comparative in nature as it will focus on reproductive rights in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1980s onwards. These two regions are intimately connected politically and economically, and in regards to reproductive rights. For example, the gag rule introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 jeopardized the reproductive health services provided in Latin American countries that received funding from the U.S. government. Yet another way that these two regions have been coupled is through feminist networks that have been working to expand reproductive rights in the Americas.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:WGSS 248-01

Against the swirling backdrop of political discourses about women in the Islamic world, this course will engage with feminist and postcolonial debates through literary works by Muslim women writers. The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:WGSS 263-01

Word for word, Emily Dickinson is the most powerful writer in the history of the English language. She is the King of All Media, the feature star in movies, television, radio, lawsuits and criminal investigations, novels, AI language models, cookbooks, museums, a video game, and just about every other possible platform of public fascination. Barring Shakespeare, no other English or American poet has been the focus of such fervid public devotion. What’s behind this cult of Dickinson? In our class you will find out. You will study Dickinson’s poems, which are teasingly fun, hair-raisingly creepy, romantically uplifting, existentially wrenching, philosophically staggering, and aesthetically gorgeous. You will also study Dickinson herself. Transformed into a mythical figure since her death in 1886, she has been used as a symbol to embody a range of bitterly conflicting cultural fantasies. To understand the history of Emily Dickinson is to understand some of the most painful—and liberating—ideological revolutions in modern US history. This course fulfills the19th-c. American literature requirement for the English major.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:WGSS 294-01

This course is designed to teach students how to think like Africanist historians to interpret the stories of the past in meaningful and accurate ways. Since interpretation is central to creating or narrating history, students will learn how the degree of accuracy can be skewed in the construction and reconstruction of narrations of the past. Students will learn about and use ideas and methods that inform both feminist theories and historical thinking. The aim of Women in African History is to use case studies to examine the lived experiences of various women from different parts of Africa who lived from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century.

A history of feminism and feminist thought in the United States between 1848-2022, this course focuses on women’s rights: the ideologies, leaders, and actions that forced change in long-held gender roles and patriarchal governing norms. We will also interrogate the myths, hypocrisies, and the backlash moments that are central to United States history, culture, and politics in the context of women’s rights.

Much about mainstream narratives of gender transgression are determined by powerful, cis-dominated institutions, still even to this day: the media, schools, police, the law, doctors and psychiatrists. These are institutions structured by a racialized, heteronormative gender binary, and for whom trans people pose a problem to be managed. Oral history offers the possibility for trans people to tell their own stories, and, in doing so, give more nuanced, complex analysis of identity, activism, and of the intersectional operations of systems of power. Oral history also makes room for the complex interplay of joy, playfulness, grief, anxiety, and connection that makes queer and trans life so valuable. In this project-based and community engaged course, students will have hands on experience working with an archive of queer and trans oral histories in the context of the pandemic and uprisings for racial justice. Working closely with our community partner, the Tretter Transgender Oral History Project, we will learn about oral history methodology and interview techniques, and then have the opportunity to conduct oral history interviews, develop audio or video projects using extant oral histories, and contribute to an online archive of queer and trans oral history.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:WGSS 305-01

This course explores how bodily practices of fasting and sexual abstinence have shaped Christian identities from the first century, C.E. to today. From Paul of Tarsus’ instructions about sexual discipline to the True Love Waits® campaign, from the desert fathers’ rigorous bodily regimens to the contemporary Christian diet movement, Christians have often understood the practice of renunciation as a necessary feature of spiritual perfection. In this course we will consider several ascetic movements in Christian history, including the development of ascetic practice in late antiquity, the rise of fasting practices among women in medieval Europe, and the culture of Christian dieting and chastity in the U.S. We will pay special attention to how Christian practices of piety both draw upon and contribute to cultural understandings of gender and the body.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:WGSS 325-01

By engaging recent work in queer and trans studies, feminist studies, and critical prison studies, we will consider how prisons and policing have shaped the making and remaking of race, gender, and sexuality from slavery and conquest to the contemporary period. We will examine how police and prisons have regulated the body, identity, and populations, and the larger social, political, and cultural changes connected to these processes. While we will focus on the carceral system itself, we will also think of policing in a more expansive way by analyzing the racialized regulation of gender and sexuality on the plantation, in the colony, at the border, in the welfare office, and in the hospital, among other spaces, historical periods, and places.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceGeneral Education Requirements:U.S Identities and DifferencesCourse Materials:WGSS 355-01

What is "disability" and what does an understanding of disability tell us about human experience more generally? What is a "disability identity" and what implications might claiming that identity have for psychological well-being and social change? How do stereotypes of disabled people and expectations of "normality" affect everyone’s lives (not just those with disabilities)? Why don’t many Deaf people consider themselves "disabled?" What might we learn from shifting the "problem" of disability from the individual person to the social environment? How do sexism, racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression influence how different bodies are viewed, treated, educated, and experienced? This course will explore questions that emerge from thinking about the experience of disability (and its intersection with identities based on gender, race, class, and sexuality). Our work together will be grounded in critical disability and Deaf studies frameworks that are themselves informed by and in conversation with feminist, queer, and critical race theories and perspectives. Through a consideration of the socially, culturally, linguistically, and historically constructed meanings of physical, sensory, and cognitive "impairments," the course will rely on theoretical and empirical readings from psychology and related disciplines, personal essays, film/video, and guest visitors as we explore the social and psychological meanings of disability.

Art reflects, refracts and helps construct a society’s culture. Thousands of pieces of sculpture survive from the ancient Roman period and can provide valuable information to the historian. Material from Rome includes looted Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian sculpture, copies of antique masterpieces, and new creations combining different styles for varied purposes. After we develop a basic history and understanding of Roman sculpture, this course will examine select pieces each week to explore questions that may be productively brought to bear on this unusual historical source. For example, the popularity and adaptations of masterpieces of Venus, Dionysus and Apollo will be used to explore the way artists shaped differences between male and female and the cultural assumptions about sexuality and the body these works communicate (Knidian Aphrodite, Praxitelean youths, Sleeping Hermaphrodite). In turn, we will investigate how these artistic conventions for gender could be employed to communicate the subjugation of enslaved or conquered people and the authority of the emperor (Antinoos Sculptures, Suicide Gauls, Dying Gaul, Marcus Aurelius reliefs, Portonaccio Sarcophagus). We will also look at self-representation, including how former slaves chose to present themselves in hyper-realistic portraits on their tombs; how this may have impacted Roman portraiture as a whole; and what it meant for some members of the elite to put such hyper-realistic portrait heads onto the bodies of gods and goddesses (Tomb of the Haterii, Tomb of Rabiria, Tivoli General, Flavian Matron as Venus). What can these varied representations of the human form tell us about the complex interplay of legal status, citizenship, gender, nudity, ethnicity, power, vulnerability and identity in the Roman Empire? The course will meet once a week during the day to allow for two field trips to see sculpture in the round. Responses to the weekly readings will be due every week. During the last third of the course, students will direct our classwork as they build toward a final project.

 Prerequisite(s): This course focuses on reproductive health as a human right following the reproductive justice framework. It will focus on women and how they navigate the system to expand their rights. The course will pay particular attention to women who are marginalized due to their race, class, gender identity, indigeneity, and religion. In doing so, this course studies reproductive health and human rights in relation to the broader structural context in the Americas (e.g. national laws and international conventions). As the topic of women’s reproductive rights is vast, we will be focusing on abortion, domestic violence, and motherhood. Students in the class will study these issues from the perspective of women’s organizations that have mobilized to expand reproductive rights. This course will be comparative in nature as it will focus on reproductive rights in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1980s onwards. These two regions are intimately connected politically and economically, and in regards to reproductive rights. For example, the gag rule introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 jeopardized the reproductive health services provided in Latin American countries that received funding from the U.S. government. Yet another way that these two regions have been coupled is through feminist networks that have been working to expand reproductive rights in the Americas.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:WGSS 248-01

The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesGeneral Education Requirements:Internationalism, Writing WPCourse Materials:WGSS 263-01

 Word for word, Emily Dickinson is the most powerful writer in the history of the English language. She is the King of All Media, the feature star in movies, television, radio, lawsuits and criminal investigations, novels, AI language models, cookbooks, museums, a video game, and just about every other possible platform of public fascination. Barring Shakespeare, no other English or American poet has been the focus of such fervid public devotion. What’s behind this cult of Dickinson? In our class you will find out. You will study Dickinson’s poems, which are teasingly fun, hair-raisingly creepy, romantically uplifting, existentially wrenching, philosophically staggering, and aesthetically gorgeous. You will also study Dickinson herself. Transformed into a mythical figure since her death in 1886, she has been used as a symbol to embody a range of bitterly conflicting cultural fantasies. To understand the history of Emily Dickinson is to understand some of the most painful—and liberating—ideological revolutions in modern US history. This course fulfills the19th-c.

Working closely with our community partner, the Tretter Transgender Oral History Project, we will learn about oral history methodology and interview techniques, and then have the opportunity to conduct oral history interviews, develop audio or video projects using extant oral histories, and contribute to an online archive of queer and trans oral history.

 This course explores how bodily practices of fasting and sexual abstinence have shaped Christian identities from the first century, C.E. to today. From Paul of Tarsus’ instructions about sexual discipline to the True Love Waits® campaign, from the desert fathers’ rigorous bodily regimens to the contemporary Christian diet movement, Christians have often understood the practice of renunciation as a necessary feature of spiritual perfection. In this course we will consider several ascetic movements in Christian history, including the development of ascetic practice in late antiquity, the rise of fasting practices among women in medieval Europe, and the culture of Christian dieting and chastity in the U.S. We will pay special attention to how Christian practices of piety both draw upon and contribute to cultural understandings of gender and the body.

 This course explores the history and politics of, and theoretical approaches to, gender and sexuality in relation to the racial politics of mass incarceration, or what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls the "carceral geography" of the United States. By engaging recent work in queer and trans studies, feminist studies, and critical prison studies, we will consider how prisons and policing have shaped the making and remaking of race, gender, and sexuality from slavery and conquest to the contemporary period. We will examine how police and prisons have regulated the body, identity, and populations, and the larger social, political, and cultural changes connected to these processes. While we will focus on the carceral system itself, we will also think of policing in a more expansive way by analyzing the racialized regulation of gender and sexuality on the plantation, in the colony, at the border, in the welfare office, and in the hospital, among other spaces, historical periods, and places.

 What is "disability" and what does an understanding of disability tell us about human experience more generally? What is a "disability identity" and what implications might claiming that identity have for psychological well-being and social change? How do stereotypes of disabled people and expectations of "normality" affect everyone’s lives (not just those with disabilities)? Why don’t many Deaf people consider themselves "disabled?" What might we learn from shifting the "problem" of disability from the individual person to the social environment? How do sexism, racism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression influence how different bodies are viewed, treated, educated, and experienced? This course will explore questions that emerge from thinking about the experience of disability (and its intersection with identities based on gender, race, class, and sexuality). Our work together will be grounded in critical disability and Deaf studies frameworks that are themselves informed by and in conversation with feminist, queer, and critical race theories and perspectives. Through a consideration of the socially, culturally, linguistically, and historically constructed meanings of physical, sensory, and cognitive "impairments," the course will rely on theoretical and empirical readings from psychology and related disciplines, personal essays, film/video, and guest visitors as we explore the social and psychological meanings of disability.

 Art reflects, refracts and helps construct a society’s culture. Thousands of pieces of sculpture survive from the ancient Roman period and can provide valuable information to the historian. Material from Rome includes looted Greek, Etruscan and Egyptian sculpture, copies of antique masterpieces, and new creations combining different styles for varied purposes. After we develop a basic history and understanding of Roman sculpture, this course will examine select pieces each week to explore questions that may be productively brought to bear on this unusual historical source. For example, the popularity and adaptations of masterpieces of Venus, Dionysus and Apollo will be used to explore the way artists shaped differences between male and female and the cultural assumptions about sexuality and the body these works communicate (Knidian Aphrodite, Praxitelean youths, Sleeping Hermaphrodite). In turn, we will investigate how these artistic conventions for gender could be employed to communicate the subjugation of enslaved or conquered people and the authority of the emperor (Antinoos Sculptures, Suicide Gauls, Dying Gaul, Marcus Aurelius reliefs, Portonaccio Sarcophagus). We will also look at self-representation, including how former slaves chose to present themselves in hyper-realistic portraits on their tombs; how this may have impacted Roman portraiture as a whole; and what it meant for some members of the elite to put such hyper-realistic portrait heads onto the bodies of gods and goddesses (Tomb of the Haterii, Tomb of Rabiria, Tivoli General, Flavian Matron as Venus). What can these varied representations of the human form tell us about the complex interplay of legal status, citizenship, gender, nudity, ethnicity, power, vulnerability and identity in the Roman Empire? The course will meet once a week during the day to allow for two field trips to see sculpture in the round. Responses to the weekly readings will be due every week. During the last third of the course, students will direct our classwork as they build toward a final project. No formal prerequisites, but some prior experience with ancient art, art history or Roman history is recommended.
 
 This experience brings you to the intersection of some paths you have taken in WGSS!  The goals of the course are to work collectively in reviewing feminist, queer, and trans genealogies that you have been learning about in your WGSS career, to contextualize our places in relation to them, and to test past and present frameworks so we can imagine together how they may be part of our future experiences.  Most importantly, this course will be an opportunity to connect theories to your own feminist/queer/trans practices towards positive social change, and look at ways to craft your post-graduation careers and professions.

 Prerequisite(s): This course focuses on reproductive health as a human right following the reproductive justice framework. It will focus on women and how they navigate the system to expand their rights. The course will pay particular attention to women who are marginalized due to their race, class, gender identity, indigeneity, and religion. In doing so, this course studies reproductive health and human rights in relation to the broader structural context in the Americas (e.g. national laws and international conventions). As the topic of women’s reproductive rights is vast, we will be focusing on abortion, domestic violence, and motherhood. Students in the class will study these issues from the perspective of women’s organizations that have mobilized to expand reproductive rights. This course will be comparative in nature as it will focus on reproductive rights in the U.S. and Latin America from the 1980s onwards. These two regions are intimately connected politically and economically, and in regards to reproductive rights. For example, the gag rule introduced by the Reagan administration in 1984 jeopardized the reproductive health services provided in Latin American countries that received funding from the U.S. government. Yet another way that these two regions have been coupled is through feminist networks that have been working to expand reproductive rights in the Americas.Distribution Requirements:Social scienceCourse Materials:WGSS 248-01

 Word for word, Emily Dickinson is the most powerful writer in the history of the English language. She is the King of All Media, the feature star in movies, television, radio, lawsuits and criminal investigations, novels, AI language models, cookbooks, museums, a video game, and just about every other possible platform of public fascination. Barring Shakespeare, no other English or American poet has been the focus of such fervid public devotion. What’s behind this cult of Dickinson? In our class you will find out. You will study Dickinson’s poems, which are teasingly fun, hair-raisingly creepy, romantically uplifting, existentially wrenching, philosophically staggering, and aesthetically gorgeous. You will also study Dickinson herself. Transformed into a mythical figure since her death in 1886, she has been used as a symbol to embody a range of bitterly conflicting cultural fantasies. To understand the history of Emily Dickinson is to understand some of the most painful—and liberating—ideological revolutions in modern US history. This course fulfills the19th-c. American literature requirement for the English major.Distribution Requirements:HumanitiesCourse Materials:WGSS 294-01

 Much about mainstream narratives of gender transgression are determined by powerful, cis-dominated institutions, still even to this day: the media, schools, police, the law, doctors and psychiatrists. These are institutions structured by a racialized, heteronormative gender binary, and for whom trans people pose a problem to be managed. Oral history offers the possibility for trans people to tell their own stories, and, in doing so, give more nuanced, complex analysis of identity, activism, and of the intersectional operations of systems of power. Oral history also makes room for the complex interplay of joy, playfulness, grief, anxiety, and connection that makes queer and trans life so valuable.

We will also look at self-representation, including how former slaves chose to present themselves in hyper-realistic portraits on their tombs; how this may have impacted Roman portraiture as a whole; and what it meant for some members of the elite to put such hyper-realistic portrait heads onto the bodies of gods and goddesses (Tomb of the Haterii, Tomb of Rabiria, Tivoli General, Flavian Matron as Venus). What can these varied representations of the human form tell us about the complex interplay of legal status, citizenship, gender, nudity, ethnicity, power, vulnerability and identity in the Roman Empire? The course will meet once a week during the day to allow for two field trips to see sculpture in the round. Responses to the weekly readings will be due every week. During the last third of the course, students will direct our classwork as they build toward a final project. No formal prerequisites, but some prior experience with ancient art, art history or Roman history is recommended.

Course Details:
 This experience brings you to the intersection of some paths you have taken in WGSS!  The goals of the course are to work collectively in reviewing feminist, queer, and trans genealogies that you have been learning about in your WGSS career, to contextualize our places in relation to them, and to test past and present frameworks so we can imagine together how they may be part of our future experiences.  Most importantly, this course will be an opportunity to connect theories to your own feminist/queer/trans practices towards positive social change, and look at ways to craft your post-graduation careers and professions.Course Materials:WGSS 400-01
