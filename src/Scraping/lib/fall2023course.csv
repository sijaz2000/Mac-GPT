,,,,,,"From the Philippine-American War (1898-1910) to the global uprisings of May 2020, white supremacy and US imperialism have marched hand-in-hand, buttressed by cultures of violence and literal guns and tanks. Yet cracks in the walls of racism and empire have also always existed, with gestures of solidarity and whole solidarity movements pushing forward with new possibilities and imagined futures. In this discussion-based course, we will look for the common threads that link David Fagen (Black U.S. army soldier who defected and joined the Philippine nationalists in 1899) to the Vietnam antiwar movement (1955-1975) and to Grace Lee Boggs (Chinese American philosopher activist based in Detroit, 1905-2015) along with many other individuals and events. Among the significant questions we will consider are: What makes an insurrectionist different from an ally or a rabble rouser or a survivalist? What lessons can be drawn from the global COVID pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine? How can we replace a culture of violence with a culture of peace? Books and films include: The White Racial Frame (Joe Feagin), How to be an Anti-Racist (Ibram X. Kendi), ""Amigo"" (John Sayles), ""American Revolutionary"" (Grace Lee).

,,,,,,"From Caitlyn Jenner to Laverne Cox, CeCe MacDonald to Chelsea Manning, Transparent to Pose, trans people are experiencing unprecedented media coverage. In fact, some years ago now Time Magazine declared that we are at the ""transgender tipping point."" And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see a massive wave of legislation across the country seeking to limit trans people’s access to public space, to healthcare, and to self-determination. Alongside this, The National Coalition of Antiviolence Projects reports that 2020 saw a record number of murders of transgender individuals, in particular trans women of color. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In this class, we will ask: What has gender non-conformity meant in various historical moments? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans embodiment and politics open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise?

,,,,,,"The history of American Indians is wonderfully complex, but this history is simultaneously fraught with misconceptions and misinterpretations. European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation’s indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.

To some extent, we will engage in a genre study. How does genre—autobiography, biography/history, fiction, hip hop and outlaw cultures—influence representation? How do we think about the continuities and discontinuities among historical, autobiographical, and fictional representations of Malcolm X? Questions we will explore include: Who is representing Malcolm, how and why? How are the various representations inflected by their respective media and genre? Why do we engage in myth-making? Can we distinguish Malcolm the man from Malcolm the myth? How does the religious studies category of “hagiography help us to understand some representations of Malcolm X? What are the perils of hagiography? Was Malcolm’s religion merely a prop for his politics? Assuming it was not, how do we do justice to the religious dimensions of his life?

The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling.

Entrepreneurs, gig workers, online contractors and now an unprecedented number of telecommuters are challenging conventional models of the nine-to-five job. But nine-to-five has hardly been the norm throughout history, nor does it describe the typical work experience around the world today. This course takes an anthropological approach to consider the contemporary diversity of working worlds and worker experiences, as well as important historical shifts that have brought us to this moment, are currently underway, and will carry us into new working futures. Gender, race, class, and age are all deeply implicated in unequal systems here, as are powerful environmental, economic and political forces. Who has to work? Who gets to work? Who is able to work safely? Who is empowered by it and who is exploited? Why do we work? What work is most valued? When will the robots come for our jobs? What might a world without work look like? Drawing on examples from around the world, and materials ranging from ethnographic writing and film to popular media, u/dystopian fiction, this seminar dives deep to take a comparative approach to these and other pressing questions raised by today’s diverse and shifting worlds of work.

Examples of fabrication methods may include basic woodworking techniques, carving, basic sewing techniques, ""non-traditional"" techniques, and others. The early part of the semester is devoted to brief exercises that introduce materials, processes, techniques, tools/equipment, and ways of thinking/unthinking. The latter part of the semester is devoted to fully realized individual projects. Final projects are self-assigned and self-directed via prompts. In addition to the formal and spatial aspects of the sculptures we create, we will consider their symbolic, sociopolitical, ethical, material, and tactile dimensions. Slide presentations, short readings, critiques, group discussions, and gallery/museum visits supplement our studio research. The goal of this class is to conduct a serious and sustained - yet playful - inquiry into the question of sculpture while nurturing individual expression.

We will begin with an overview of the history of feminism and feminist art in Europe and the United States but quickly extend our study to contemporary  examples of feminist art, gender, and sexualities as they have been articulated by artists based in Africa, Australia, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Russia. During the course of this semester, students will develop an understanding that feminism is not an assumed, universal category or identity. Rather it is a constellation of different ideologies that contests heteropatriarchy, transphobia, racism, xenophobia, ableism, ageism, and religious fundamentalism. We will explore how transnational feminist trends and the LGBTQIIA+, nonbinary, genderqueer artists and communities expand our vision for justice and allow us to see the complex demands for political and social change globally.

Trips to local galleries, printshops and museums add depth to understanding the diverse contexts in which contemporary prints are made, as well as the vital role prints play in social movements. In addition to exchanging prints within the class, students research and identify an external opportunity to share their prints. Students will be required to purchase some class materials from an art store.

Early in the semester, all students will participate in a weekend retreat at the Ordway Field Station. Weekly lab sessions will include field days during which course members design and implement educational experiences for elementary school children at Ordway, small group work days for preparing field day lesson plans, trips to local outdoor environmental education sites within the Twin Cities, and other experiential learning opportunities.  Weekly seminar sessions incorporating readings, reflective writing, and individual and small group projects complement the experiential aspects of the course. As the semester progresses, each course member will develop a curricular unit aimed at teaching an important environmental issue to diverse adolescents attending urban public schools.  The curricular unit is a significant undertaking that provides students with the opportunity to synthesize all aspects of the course material in a creative, pragmatic and integrative manner.

This trend (and the environmental problems it creates) will only increase throughout the 21st century, yet ecologists are just beginning to understand humans as organisms that influence their environment. Cities are hubs of activity that influence the physical structure, climate, element and energy cycling, and plant and animal communities within the urban footprint. However, these urban environments are influential well beyond their perceived borders. Urban ecologists are expanding their focus from ecology in cities, where they studied urban plants and wildlife, to the ecology of cities, where they consider human-biological interactions with increasing attention to the complex interplay among people, society, and environment. Importantly, this course acknowledges how the lived experiences of urban dwellers vary tremendously, both within and across cities. This course examines current developments in urban ecology and looks at the role it can play in planning and managing urban environments to create equitable futures for all.

The goal is to understand the multifaceted and integrated way that molecules and cells in the nervous system work together to underlie memory. The course will rely on research articles and review papers in the field, and students will develop their skills in writing and presenting for scientific audiences. Students will have an opportunity to choose their own topics for assignments. Prerequisite(s): BIOL 316

,,,,,,"Recent advances in molecular biology have lead to the ability to directly manipulate genomes in highly precise ways. CRISPR-based genome editing is a type of genetic engineering that can be used to add, replace, or delete specific sequences in an organism’s genes using specialized nucleases.  The possible applications of this methodology are far-reaching and have already been used to correct disease-causing mutations in mouse models and human cells, leading to gene therapy clinical trials and the first reported case of manipulation of human embryos. We will discuss the primary literature from this emerging field, technical hurdles that may hamper medical applications of this technology such as ""off-target"" effects, and ethical and socio-cultural issues surrounding genome modification. Three lecture/discussion hours each week. Prerequisite(s): BIOL 190 and BIOL 200; junior or senior standing; or permission of instructor.

We also learn mathematical and conceptual tools for quantifying chemical equilibrium, with an emphasis on the reactions of acids and bases. Laboratory work reinforces concepts in lecture, and also provides a review of fundamental topics, such as stoichiometry, gas laws, and solution-phase reactions, that are essential for future course work in chemistry. Three lectures and one three-hour laboratory per week. All sections of class will have regular graded homework assignments and tests. Lab fee of $12 required.

strong high school foundation in chemistry. The course begins with an intuitive introduction to quantum mechanics that we then use to explain the structure and properties of atoms and molecules. We then apply our understanding of atoms and molecules to gain a novel perspective on macroscopic concepts such as energy, entropy, and the rates of chemical reactions. Classes will largely consist of lectures and demonstrations. Weekly laboratory sessions will reinforce concepts from class and teach students how to make written scientific arguments based on experimental and computational data.

Then we explore more broadly the adaptable nature of these myths and the variety of forms in which the Greeks told stories, from epic and personal poetry to philosophy, drama, sculpture and vase painting. At the same time, we investigate the ways in which moderns have interpreted these stories. We analyze myths using Freud’s psychoanalytical techniques, as folklore and ritual, and through theoretical perspectives including structuralism, new historicism and feminism. Finally, we investigate the later life of Greek myths, focusing on how and why these stories have been retold by the Romans, later European authors and artists, American film makers and playwrights, and science fiction writers.

,,,,,,"Like Latin and Greek in Europe, Sanskrit is a highly inflected language of scholarship and revered as the perfect medium for discourse on everything from science and sex to philosophy and religion. It flourished in its classical form after the age of the Buddha (5th century BC) and served as a scholarly lingua franca in India until the Islamic period. This course serves as an introduction to the grammar an script of Sanskrit, and we will advance to a point of reading simplified texts from the classical epic Ramayana.Students will be expected to attend class regularly and spend at least ten hours a week outside class studying the grammar and vocabulary. Without this sort of effort, no progress is possible in such a complex language. In addition to the rigorous study of the language, we will consider both the role of the language in classical Indian culture and religion, and some texts from the Ramayana, looking at both English translation and Sanskrit originals.

These traditions shaped a role for the caregiver, healer- physician. They inherited traditions and practices from earlier generations and from their own schools and teachers.

Health care givers and Physicians were philosophers, botanists, observers and students of nature who built the foundations of modern medicine and continued the ancient traditions that had been handed down to them. This course is not a critique of modern medical practices. It is a retrieval of other and earlier ideas and practices about health and wellness.

This course introduces the field of computer science by using recursion—solving problems by looking at simpler versions of the same problem—and functional programming—solving problems by dividing them into small, specific tasks. We will cover central computing concepts such as the design and implementation of algorithms and programs, testing and analyzing programs, the representation of information within the computer, and the role of abstraction and metaphor in computer science. For this course, we will be working in the Racket programming language, which is derived from a rich lineage of functional programming languages in the LISP family. Along the way, you will learn about what it means for a programming language to be functional, how to decompose projects into functions, and how to use recursion to solve problems.

,,,,,,"Situated at the confluence of two rivers, the Twin Cities has been a sacred gathering place for centuries. St. Anthony Falls provided power for the region’s first lumber and flour mills and attracted settlers who founded the city of Minneapolis, displacing members of the Dakota community. Railroads enabled fast and cheap transport of agricultural products and generated wealth still evident today in the grand houses lining Summit Avenue. The Twin Cities evolved into a center for financial services, biotech, health care, education, and government, and is now home to nearly twenty Fortune-500 companies. This robust economy attracts immigrants from all over the world, whose entrepreneurial activity enriches neighborhoods like those surrounding University Avenue and Lake Street. Yet Minneapolis-Saint Paul remains one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States. Gaps in educational outcomes between white students and students of color are increasing. Many households struggle to find affordable housing. While public transit systems are expanding, Twin Cities residents commute almost exclusively by car, congesting roads and polluting the atmosphere. In this course, we will examine these contradictions and realities by applying the tools of urban economics in the classroom and in the field on class trips into the cities. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, homework, short papers, and/or take-home exams. Since this course meets only once per week—sometimes in the field—attendance is particularly important; please keep this in mind when registering. First day attendance is required.

,,,,,,"This course explores the US labor market and the government policies that influence it. We will apply and extend models from Principles of Economics to understand how market forces and government policies shape the experience of work in the US. We will address questions about labor force participation, the determinants of wages and causes of income inequality, labor market discrimination, and the effects of policies like the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and unionization. Students will learn how economists think about labor markets and labor policies, be able to interpret labor market data, and will apply these skills to contemporary policy debates.

ECON 473-01 (10902),Open Economy Macroeconomics,Meeting: M W F  9:40 - 10:40 amTHEATR 202,Instructor: Mario Solis-Garcia,0,20,,
,,,,,,"Fact 1: All countries on the planet are open to trade (yes, even Cuba or North Korea). Fact 2: Macroeconomics typically ignores Fact 1 and assumes a closed economy when offered at a basic or intermediate level. Fact 3: The only closed economy is planet Earth. Fact 4: The difference between how a closed economy works vis-a-vis an open economy is huge. Fact 5: Phrases like ""the trade balance deficit/current account worsened"" are thrown around in the media (often in a fearmongering fashion) without enough context nor background information for the public to understand what’s going on. This course takes these facts seriously and aims to complement and expand the macroeconomic foundations from ECON 371 by ""opening up"" the economy. We will study the canonical open economy models (theory) and see how these do when compared to the real world (practice). This course counts as a Group E elective. Meets concurrently with ECON 474.

We take it further, by analysis and critique, to understand education as a force for change in an inter-dependent, globalized world. Specifically, we will examine ways in which policies and practice either enhance or diminish efforts towards change that is inclusive, just, sustainable and effective in relieveing suffering, while expanding potential and capacity in those affected by social change. We take the position that, in order to be effective, building trust becomes a key to connectivity between people, groups, organizations and ideas where education, development and change are theorized and practiced. We will construct possible education frameworks around the idea of building trust, by analyzing socio-cultural issues of power, voice, silence, and discourse. (4 credits)

,,,,,,"A great detective story is arguably one of the most interactive of genres, as it urges a reader to step into the world of the mystery and solve it alongside the investigators who people the pages. This course traces evolutions in the genre, from 19th-century icons like Sherlock Holmes through early-20th-century hardboiled detectives and into very contemporary fiction. We’ll consider professional and amateur detectives in short fiction and novels, watch several films, and read one story in serial installments. We will explore how detective stories are rooted in the cultural moments of their creation and read short pieces about the genre by some of its greatest writers. The course emphasizes the pleasures of reading (Cliffhangers! Clues! Misdirection!) and what we can learn from thinking hard about what is so satisfying about a great mystery, adeptly solved. Texts vary from one semester to the next; authors may include Dorothy Sayers, Edgar Allan Poe, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Tana French, Wilkie Collins, Gladys Mitchell, Dashiell Hammett, Rudolph Fisher, Anthony Horowitz. Coursework will be wide-ranging and playful, and will include creative as well as critical assignments.

This course traces evolutions in the genre, from 19th-century icons like Sherlock Holmes through early-20th-century hardboiled detectives and into very contemporary fiction. We’ll consider professional and amateur detectives in short fiction and novels, watch several films, and read one story in serial installments. We will explore how detective stories are rooted in the cultural moments of their creation and read short pieces about the genre by some of its greatest writers. The course emphasizes the pleasures of reading (Cliffhangers! Clues! Misdirection!) and what we can learn from thinking hard about what is so satisfying about a great mystery, adeptly solved. Texts vary from one semester to the next; authors may include Dorothy Sayers, Edgar Allan Poe, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Tana French, Wilkie Collins, Gladys Mitchell, Dashiell Hammett, Rudolph Fisher, Anthony Horowitz. Coursework will be wide-ranging and playful, and will include creative as well as critical assignments.

,,,,,,"To the average reader, the field of publishing can seem somewhat opaque. How does a novel go from scribbled notes to finished paperback? What goes into editing, printing, and marketing a short story collection? This course will shed light on this exciting field through a combination of readings, talks with publishing professionals, in-class discussion, and hands-on work. We will learn about publishing by tracing the literary work through the processes of acquisition, editing, production, marketing, and publicity, and into the hands of the reader. Additional topics will include recent trends in technology, book editing, book reviewing, and the roles of the literary agent, and the independent publisher. We will take advantage of the extraordinary publishing resources in the Twin Cities and beyond through guest speakers. Assignments will include writing query letters and catalog copy, presenting publisher profiles, editing a short story, and writing a final paper on publishing issues. This course is designed for readers who want to know how the book they’re holding got into their hands, for writers who want to know what happens when they send their manuscripts to publishers, and for those interested in publishing as a future career.

,,,,,,"From E. M. Forster’s Lucy Honeychurch, who ""entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,"" to James Baldwin’s Sonny, who ""moved in an atmosphere which wasn’t like theirs at all,"" fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner’s music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in ""jazz"" by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell’s young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, ""One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn’t, the wolves and blizzards would be at one’s throat all the sooner.""

This course explores the relationship between food and print culture as means of creating shared experiences. Considering consumption in a wide range of ways—from dinner-party etiquette to commercial efforts to create desires for conspicuous consumption—we will discuss ideas of taste and the problems of trying to regulate eating/reading bodies. We will read a social problem novel from the “hungry forties,” indulge in famous literary feasts that display the excesses of the booming 1860s, and consider the relationships between food, gendered ideals, and sexuality. Non-fiction from the period provides background on working conditions, literary circulation, and consumer cultures. To balance the fact that literature may play an outsized role in shaping our consumption of the past, we will also eat our way through this course, experimenting with 19th century recipes and foods.

In this sense, poetry is a profound way to pay tribute to what we love and to what we value; in another, it is a powerful means by which to resist the forces that would fragment and economize our focus. Throughout this semester, we will practice a variety of poetic forms, ranging from sonnets, to sestinas, to composition by field, so that we might find new ways of attending to language, and thus to ourselves, to each other, and to the world. In order to reimagine the shapes our attention might take, we will consider the words of poets past and present, including work by Natalie Diaz, Seamus Heaney, Elizabeth Bishop, Ross Gay, Valzhyna Mort, Cameron Awkward-Rich, and Gwendolyn Brooks. We will also collaboratively construct a respectful writing community, where we will discuss, produce, and revise creative work with feedback from our peers. Furthermore, we will go on fieldtrips, and have the opportunity to interact with several poets who have recently published critically-acclaimed collections.

How do people of various gender identities envision a better state yet-to-be (utopia) as well as a fear of catastrophe or nightmare (dystopia)?  This course investigates how women’s literary writing from different parts of the world (Bangladeshi, British, African-American, Canadian, to name a few) produce visions of the present and the future, of the real and the imagined, beliefs about masculinity and femininity, socialist and capitalist philosophies, modernity, the environment (ecotopia), and various technologies including cybergenetics.  Texts by Thomas More, Frantz Fanon, Silvia Federici, and Noam Chomsky, and music by The Eagles and A Tribe Called Red are included.  We will explore how these texts provide some ways to think about our gendered, racialized, and classed roles, and how we can think about MeToo, Black Lives Matter, Charlottesville, and neoliberal nation-states, along with our own fantasies and realities of sociopolitical change.

Why did people turn to storytelling, poetry, drama, and other literary arts to write about illness and disability? And where might we discover evidence of disability gain in the early modern archive? We’ll learn to read a variety of genres: medical literature, herbals (self-help remedy books written for lay people), law books, joke books, ballads, poetry, maps, parish records, and drama.

,,,,,,"The story goes like this. While performing Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus—a play featuring spell-casting, necromancy, and other devilish arts—the actors noticed that “there was one devil too many amongst them.” They stopped the play; the audience panicked. Whether a true story or not (the anecdote comes down to us through a seventeenth-century source), it captures one of the “certainties” of the period: that demons, devils, witches, and other things of darkness are a part of the here and now. In this course, we explore sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tales of the demonic. At the same time, we examine how authors used the public’s fascination with the supernatural to voice religious controversies regarding freewill and election, political nightmares of state tyranny and oppression, and social crises surrounding the vanishing culture of hospitality and charity. Hence, just as characters strive to see beyond appearances and outward show, so we shall investigate the religious, political, and legal debates out of which the texts arise. Central to our study are the major works of early modern English literature such as Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, Shakespeare’s Macbeth, and Milton’s Paradise Lost, and lesser known texts such as The Witch of Edmonton, The Discovery of Witchcraft, and King James VI and I’s Daemonologie.

Poets, theorists, novelists, and filmmakers draw on the history and processes of photography to create complex visions of emotional life. From theories of memory to radical reimaginings of embodiment and place, these writers bridge technology/art and the written word to challenge popular conceptions of culture. Second, students will strengthen their critical analysis and academic writing skills, developing an original research project (note: you should plan to read Helen Sword’s Stylish Academic Writing over the summer or in the first week). Your topic will be up to you, but it will be developed in consultation with the instructor and your peers. Third, as a form of research-creation, we will undertake various photographic experiments in visual culture and analysis, and students will create a visual essay to accompany their final thesis project. We will share these hybrid research projects in a presentation at the end of the semester with the Macalester community. No artistic or photographic experience necessary. Capstone courses are intended to be a culminating experience for the English major. Only those with current JR or SR status will be allowed to register; all others need permission of instructor.

Beyond agriculture, we will also examine other sectoral issues in relation to agriculture or as stand alone environmental concerns. These themes include: human population growth, consumption, biodiversity, climate change, and environmental health. We will be trying on a number of theoretical lenses from geography’s broad human-environment tradition (such as physical geography, cultural ecology, commodity chain analysis, political ecology, resource geography, the human dimensions of global change, hazards geography and environmental justice). In other words, I not only want us to explore a range of environmental issues, but also to grapple with theory and how this informs our understanding of the human-environment interface.

In addition, we will explore how various characteristics of the natural world have affected the broad patterns of human society, sometimes harming or hindering life and other times enabling rapid development and expansion. By bringing nature into the study of human history and the human past into the study of nature, we will begin to see the connections and interdependencies between the two that are often overlooked.

,,,,,,"The Earth’s climate system is complex and dynamic, and yet understanding this system is crucial in order to address concerns about anthropogenic influences on climate. In this course, we examine the basic physical and chemical processes that control the modern climate system, including the role of incoming solar radiation, the greenhouse effect, ocean and atmospheric circulation, and El Nino. We also look critically at the methods and archives used to reconstruct climate in the past, such as ice cores, marine and lake sediments, and cave deposits. We explore the possible effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on modern and future climate by critically examining the models used in climate prediction, and discuss the challenges of modeling such a complex system. Although this course is taught from a primarily scientific perspective, it includes frequent discussions of the roles policy and economics play in the current dialogue on global climate change.

In studying these out-of-the-way places, we will read books by writers who investigate the politics of place and cross-cultural experiences of our changing planet. Taking an intersectional approach to gender, race, class dynamics, and neurodiversity, this course combines study of modernist and contemporary British writing with considerations of the environment—an approach known as ecocriticism in literary studies. While you’ll be introduced to ecocriticism and its intersecting theories of the environment, you will be encouraged to draw on your own interests and experiences with the natural world, in addition to trans-disciplinary approaches from natural history, biology, environmental studies, medicine, environmental psychology, and anthropology. We will also examine how nature takes metaphorical shape in literature, working as a group to understand how writers draw on the environment to express complex human emotions and interconnections with the non-human world.

,,,,,,"This course is built around the argument that ""environmental problems"" do not exist; they are in fact human behavior problems. Thus, if we want to craft effective solutions to issues such as ocean acidification, air pollution, or climate change, we must start with the human behaviors that lead to them. We will cover psychological principles, theories, and methods and explore the complex web of factors underlying environmentally sustainable and unsustainable actions. A strong theme throughout the semester is the intersection of identity - personal, social, and cultural - and environmentalism.  We will explore questions such as, ""Why do some groups of people feel a part of the sustainability movement while others feel alienated from it or skeptical of it?""; ""Who takes action on behalf of the natural environment, under what circumstances, and why?""; and ""How can we create contexts that promote true sustainability?"" Psychology of Sustainable Behavior is a project-based class with a strong civic engagement component. Students will participate in three class projects: a self-change project (2.5 weeks), a community-based collaborative project (5 weeks), and a communication/education project (3 weeks).

This course examines the behavioral causes of, and solutions to, climate damage. We will discuss the many ways our changing climate affects people around the world, and how it may affect human society in the long term. We will take a broad psychological perspective on the question, “Why are we not doing enough to address the global climate crisis?”, drawing upon research from many psychological sub-fields (evolutionary, biological, cognitive, social, industrial/organizational). Throughout the course we will engage with the community, hearing from climate activists, local politicians (both Republican and Democrat), scientists, city planners, business owners and health care workers to understand their experience and perspective on the issue.

We will take a broad psychological perspective on the question, “Why are we not doing enough to address the global climate crisis?”, drawing upon research from many psychological sub-fields (evolutionary, biological, cognitive, social, industrial/organizational). Throughout the course we will engage with the community, hearing from climate activists, local politicians (both Republican and Democrat), scientists, city planners, business owners and health care workers to understand their experience and perspective on the issue.

ENVI 294-02 (10454),Critical Ecologies: Theory in the Anthropocene,Meeting: M W    7:00 - 8:30 pmHUM 216,Instructor: Ross Shields,19,25,Cross-listed with GERM 294-01,Cross-listed with GERM 294-01
,,,,,,"With the advent of anthropogenic climate change and widespread species extinction, ecology must become critical no less than theory must become ecological. Among other things, this implies a thorough reevaluation of the concepts of nature and the environment, which—as their fraught history suggests—are anything but natural. In this seminar, we will examine the complex development of ecological thinking, focusing on its intersection with the critical theoretical tradition and relevance for the contemporary situation. We will ask: How do present-day concerns challenge us to reevaluate traditional distinctions between history and nature, organism and environment, human and non-human? In what way do our received notions reflect and/or support relations of capital and dominion? What resources can critical theory offer for developing alternative paradigms of interconnection among living and non-living agents? Readings may include texts by Ursula Heise, Theodor W. Adorno, Jane Bennett, Amanda Jo Goldstein, Édouard Glissant, Christoph Menke, Georges Canguilhem, Jon Bellamy Foster, Alexander von Humboldt, Gregory Bateson, Donna Haraway, Arne Naess, Bruno Latour, and Andreas Malm. In addition to ecological and critical theory, we may engage with contemporary film and literature.https://macalester.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TBListView?cm_mmc=RI-_-8345-_-1-_-A&catalogId=10001&storeId=89536&termMapping=Y&courseXml=%3C?xml%20version=%271.0%27%20encoding=%27UTF-8%27?%3E%3Ctextbookorder%3E%3Ccourses%3E%3Ccourse%20term=%27202410%27%20dept=%20%27ENVI%27%20num=%27294%27%20sect=%2702%27%20/%3E%3C/courses%3E%3C/textbookorder%3E","With the advent of anthropogenic climate change and widespread species extinction, ecology must become critical no less than theory must become ecological.

,,,,,,"Plant physiological processes in the environment regulate local, regional, and global climate and control ecosystem functioning. However, climate change is altering these processes across diverse ecosystems. We will learn about plant physiological processes, including converting light to energy, carbon cycling and storage, water transport, nutrient acquisition, growth, and the responses of these processes to an increasingly variable and potentially stressful environments. This course will also focus on scaling of carbon cycling, diving into remote sensing and global datasets, as well as novel data we collect in class to analyze with R/RStudio. We will learn about current techniques available to measure physiological processes. We will also focus on the broader process of science: how do we turn ideas into questions, questions into data, and data into compelling stories about the natural world?

,,,,,,"National governments that are parties to the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are engaged in intensive negotiations leading up to the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP-28) scheduled for Dubai in December 2023.  Leaders will be pressured to increase their national contributions to maintain the commitments to hold warming to the 1.5C objective. Given these goals, COP28 will involve high-level ministerial delegations from most of the 195 signatory countries, as well as vast participation from NGOs, civil society, scientists and the business community.

This class will meet twice a month in the lead up to COP28. Students enrolled in this seminar will function as a research team and observe negotiations at COP28 for one week.  To prepare, we will investigate the history of climate negotiations, the cultures of UN conferences, and the views of selected parties in the negotiations. We will draw on their newly acquired knowledge to develop research questions and a research plan for fieldwork. Students will be expected to share their experience with campus and the wider community during and after COP28. Please note that students will miss one week of Macalester classes in December 2023, and will be expected to communicate with their other faculty about this absence.

Over the last decade, certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as ""political ecology."" The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts. Towards the end of the course we will explore how one might begin to think in practical terms about facilitating development in marginal environments. Prerequisite(s): Permission of instructor.

,,,,,,"What does it mean to describe a society as “healthy” or “diseased,” or compare the illnesses or wellbeing of individuals to those of the “social body”? And can social institutions and practices be “diagnosed” and “cured”? In this course, we will explore how eighteenth-century French writers understood health and illness as conditions to which the individual body and mind were susceptible, and also as metaphors to understand society and conceptualize social reform. Late eighteenth-century France experienced a Medical Enlightenment, in which advances in physiology and medicine led writers and social reformers to advocate for improvements in medical care and treatment, and lay the foundations for the emerging field of public health. On the eve of the French Revolution, however, a new French “medical science of man” also prescribed remedies for the diseases of society as well of individuals, aiming to restore both to conditions of health and vigor. Our main course objective will be to think critically about how French intellectuals understood health and disease both as lived experiences and as images for social critique during the Enlightenment. We will also consider how our own conceptions of health and disease as lived experiences and social metaphors compare or differ from those of late eighteenth-century France. Our readings will include short fiction and essays by authors including Louis-Sébastien Mercier; Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Denis Diderot; Buffon; Émilie du Châtelet; Voltaire; Olympe de Gouges; Madame de Staël; the Abbé Sieyès; and Robespierre. The class will be taught mainly in seminar/discussion format with some short lectures, debates and historical simulations, and a fieldtrip to the University of Minnesota’s Wangensteen Medical Library. Coursework will include a series of short papers, oral presentations, written exams, and one longer research paper. You will be expected to present and defend your ideas using arguments and evidence, and attempt to persuade and engage with the ideas of other students. All materials will be in English.

,,,,,,"Human geography studies the dynamic development of our world. Across sub-disciplines that may focus on cities, politics, economics, cultures, population, or many other subjects, human geographers share some fundamental conceptual tools to understand our world and embrace similar approaches to producing geographic knowledge about it. In this course, we will together explore these epistemological and methodological bases of the discipline. We will start with the histories and various traditions of geography and advance to key geographic concepts such as space, time, place, scale, landscape, system, nature, development, globalization and risk. We will also survey approaches of practicing human geography and consider vital questions like what data to use, which methods to employ, and what analyses to perform. By bringing the ""knowing"" and the ""doing"" of human geography together, this course aims to help students appreciate that human geography is not a collection of geographical facts, but an intellectual institution always open to new perspectives and approaches, and constantly evolving with our societies. Prerequisite(s): Not open to students who’ve passed Advanced Placement (AP) Human Geography.

,,,,,,"The Neotropical realm is a region that includes tropical areas in the Americas and South America’s temperate zone. These areas provide important environmental services like water, climate regulation, and biodiversity. They also support human populations and livelihoods. This course examines the main types of landscapes in the Neotropics, such as rainforests, deserts, and temperate forests. We will study the climate, ecology, and people of each area, including indigenous communities and others. We will also learn about how humans interact with these environments, such as through changing the land, conserving natural resources and cultures, and adapting to the impacts of climate change. To enhance the learning experience, we will employ various teaching methods, such as readings, short lectures, discussions, class activities, essays, invited speakers and field trips. As an Argumentative Writing (WA) class, students should be prepared to write approximately 5,000 words of text.

The central point of the course is to examine how the built environments of cities are shaped by human activity and how, in turn, urban life is shaped by the built environment. The course focuses on American cities and Minneapolis-St. Paul in particular. This course takes advantage of Macalester’s location by introducing you to the urban environment of the Twin Cities and connecting you to its history, landscapes, communities, and institutions through case studies, field study exercises, and visits with experts working in organizations and institutions in the local community. This course will demand a lot from you, but it should be a lot of fun and offer a formative learning experience, not only about cities, but about the discipline of geography, the liberal arts, and even yourself.

Political geography offers concepts and approaches to help us think through the complex intersections of people, place, and politics that constitute the struggle to create and maintain nation-states. Thus the first part of the course is devoted to enhancing your understanding of core concepts, such as nation, state, territory, sovereignty, scale, borders, and geographical imagination. The ultimate purpose of this first part of the course then is to assemble a framework for understanding why our contemporary organization of territory throughout the world looks the way it does. Equipped with these foundations, we explore topics in the second part of class that help you think critically about the stability of nations and the organization of territory into the nation-state system as well as challenges to these institutions. Toward this end, you will also conduct an independent research project on a single group’s attempt to foster national self-determination. Throughout the course, we will bring our investigations to bear on everyday life, exploring how nations and nationalism shape our world in dramatic and mundane ways.

This course uses the critical perspective of ""global urbanism"" to both contextualize and connect different urban experiences across places. We will introduce various urban settings and demonstrate how complex relations between urbanization, globalization, and economic development produce spatial unevenness and social inequality. We will study the dominant paradigm of world and global cities, which prioritizes development trajectories of cities in the global North, and discuss contesting views focusing on ""ordinary cities"" from the global South. Drawing on case studies in the developed and less-developed world, we will also learn how to apply the relational comparative urbanism approach as well as regionally based theoretical perspectives to comprehend the diverse urban landscapes around the globe.

,,,,,,"Public health is an integral but often overlooked aspect of the historical development of Latin America and the Caribbean. While it is hard to generalize about such a diverse region, many countries (e.g., Cuba, Chile, and Costa Rica) have achieved ""first-world"" standards of public health despite relatively low levels of economic development. Health has also been a key issue in debates about the scope of national welfare states, and intersects with many other social and political issues, such as the role of women in society, race and ethnicity, and social inequality. This interdisciplinary course draws on the instructor’s research experience as a health geographer who focuses on current and historical public health issues in Latin America. Topics to be covered include the impact of epidemic diseases in the European conquest of the New World; medical pluralism, complementary and alternative health practices, including indigenous medicine; hygiene, sanitation, and the shaping of urban environments (special focus on Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro); race, nationalism, and health in the Latin American eugenics movement; social medicine, socialist health systems alternatives, and the development of the Latin American welfare state; geopolitics and US hegemony in international health institutions (focus on the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pan American Health Organization); malaria eradication in Latin America—where it succeeded, where it failed and why; the politics of family planning, birth control, and abortion starting in the 1960s; the HIV/AIDS epidemic and national responses starting in the 1980s; and the national responses to the Covid-19 pandemic of recent years. Students will apply new perspectives and methodologies in a collective research project on historical or contemporary issues in Latin American public health. Prerequisites: none.

,,,,,,"A concern for the relationship between nature and society has been one of the pillars of geographic inquiry, and has also been an important bridge between other disciplines. By the 1960s, this area of inquiry was referred to variously as ""human ecology"" or ""cultural ecology."" Since the 1990s certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as ""political ecology."" The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts. Towards the end of the course students will explore how one might begin to think in practical terms about facilitating development in marginal environments. Prerequisite(s): Permission of instructor.

By the 1960s, this area of inquiry was referred to variously as ""human ecology"" or ""cultural ecology."" Since the 1990s certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as ""political ecology."" The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts. Towards the end of the course students will explore how one might begin to think in practical terms about facilitating development in marginal environments. Prerequisite(s): Permission of instructor. Prior completion of a geography course(s) with an environmental or development focus is encouraged.

,,,,,,"Dinosaurs dominated Earth’s landscapes for nearly 200 million years, and then seemingly vanished in one of the ""big-five"" mass extinctions that punctuate the history of life. In this course we’ll ""dig in"" to explore dinosaurs in their world and examine their evolution, biology, and behavior.  Along the way we’ll meet the supporting cast of non-dino neighbors that live alongside dinosaurs within their Mesozoic ecosystems. We’ll examine the dramatic diversification and astounding ecological success of dinosaurs, and investigate theories for their sudden disappearance 66 million years ago. Far from being dimwitted icons of extinction, they are the ultimate survivors -- dinosaurs still populate your backyard birdfeeder!

These processes range from the very large (volcanism and mountain-building) to the microscopic (frost cracking of rock, soil creep, and chemical weathering along mineralogic grain boundaries). Some processes occur frequently across geographic boundaries and throughout geologic time (like rainsplash), while others are stochastic in nature and dramatic in their geomorphic signature (like glacial outburst floods). We will focus on the roles of rivers, glaciers, and mass movements in shaping landscapes, but will examine wide-ranging landscapes such as arid environments and coastal regions.

,,,,,,"A cyborg is any technologically enhanced human being. Defined this way, cyborgs are present wherever people grow attached to their technology: from brain-computer interfaces, to artificial limbs, to you and your smartphone. Arguably, humans have always been cyborgs, all the way back to homo sapiens—the animal whose distinguishing characteristic was their use of tools. In this course, we will explore the cyborg across a wide range of cultural and theoretical sources, from literature (E.T.A Hoffmann’s “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,” on which the ballet is based; Goethe’s Faust; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein) to film (Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, the main inspiration for Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner) to material history (puppets, marionettes, and 19th-century toy manufacturing in Nuremberg). We’ll read philosophical anthropology on the idea of the human as deficient being, compelled to reinvent itself with tools and technology in order to survive. Discussion topics will include: what does the cyborg in culture and theory tell us about the limits of the human? Where does culture begin and biology end? Why are cyborgs either hyper-gendered, androgynous, or both at the same time, and what does this tell us about gender? Weekly reading responses; several short essays spread over the semester; a final, building on the shorter essays. The course counts for the argumentative writing and internationalism general education requirements. Taught in English; no prerequisites.

In this course we shall examine the relation of religion to both capital and the modern forms of political power (what Michel Foucault termed biopolitics or biopower), as well as the biopolitical formations of race and racism as means for sustaining power-while discovering the enduring pertinence of Marx’s work in theorizing the above issues. Biopower emerges gradually in secular capitalist modernity as a form of power that legitimizes itself not through its right to ""take life"" (as in traditional forms of sovereignty) but through its obligation to protect and enhance life. Yet, albeit ""secular,"" biopower is a form of ""pastoral power"" (Foucault). We shall explore: the interconnectedness of modern biopower and religion; Marx’s critique of the dominant (Enlightenment) critique of religion and his thesis that the secular state presupposes religion; the colonial and racial constructions of religion; racial capitalism; the biopolitical constructions of race in its relation to social class and other forms of domination; and anti-racist criticisms of both Foucault and Marx.

GERM 294-01 (10453),Critical Ecologies: Theory in the Anthropocene,Meeting: M W    7:00 - 8:30 pmHUM 216,Instructor: Ross Shields,19,25,Cross-listed with ENVI 294-02,Cross-listed with ENVI 294-02
,,,,,,"With the advent of anthropogenic climate change and widespread species extinction, ecology must become critical no less than theory must become ecological. Among other things, this implies a thorough reevaluation of the concepts of nature and the environment, which—as their fraught history suggests—are anything but natural. In this seminar, we will examine the complex development of ecological thinking, focusing on its intersection with the critical theoretical tradition and relevance for the contemporary situation. We will ask: How do present-day concerns challenge us to reevaluate traditional distinctions between history and nature, organism and environment, human and non-human? In what way do our received notions reflect and/or support relations of capital and dominion? What resources can critical theory offer for developing alternative paradigms of interconnection among living and non-living agents? Readings may include texts by Ursula Heise, Theodor W. Adorno, Jane Bennett, Amanda Jo Goldstein, Édouard Glissant, Christoph Menke, Georges Canguilhem, Jon Bellamy Foster, Alexander von Humboldt, Gregory Bateson, Donna Haraway, Arne Naess, Bruno Latour, and Andreas Malm. In addition to ecological and critical theory, we may engage with contemporary film and literature.

Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War.

The historical voices and perspectives of childhood that we study will pay close attention to the significance of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, time periods, and social settings. Some questions we will consider relevant to the study of history: Do children have agency? What is the role of children as subjects in history? How has childhood been socially and historically constructed? Why are children such galvanizing social and political symbols? How is identity shaped in childhood and what impact does this have on adult society at certain historical moments?

,,,,,,"What does it mean to be “between Europe and Asia?” How have people who have inhabited the territory of present-day Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Baltic states for centuries dealt with finding themselves in between the two worlds? How did these groups of diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds interact with one another? The course explores these questions and the history of peoples and spaces in Northern Eurasia from the medieval period to the fall of the Soviet Union. Stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, Northern Eurasia has been a place of intensive cultural, economic, and political exchange for many centuries. This exchange resulted in trade, wars, imperial rule, and revolutions, as well as socialist experiments. This course will examine these contacts and consider the following topics: the historical geography of Northern Eurasia; Eurasian identities and indigeneity; ideas of Russianness, imperialism, and Orientalism; nation-building and the Soviet empire.

How did these groups of diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds interact with one another? The course explores these questions and the history of peoples and spaces in Northern Eurasia from the medieval period to the fall of the Soviet Union. Stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, Northern Eurasia has been a place of intensive cultural, economic, and political exchange for many centuries. This exchange resulted in trade, wars, imperial rule, and revolutions, as well as socialist experiments. This course will examine these contacts and consider the following topics: the historical geography of Northern Eurasia; Eurasian identities and indigeneity; ideas of Russianness, imperialism, and Orientalism; nation-building and the Soviet empire. This course will be an excellent introduction to Eurasian and Russian Studies, as well as an introduction to the issues of imperialism, colonialism, and nationalism in a global context.

,,,,,,"This reading- and writing-intensive course will explore one of the most tragic and transformative events of the 20th century: The Holocaust. Over the course of the semester, we will ask: What made the Holocaust possible? In what ways did Nazi genocide in the 1940s build on previous centuries of religious and racial prejudice? What factors shaped the way that people experienced the Holocaust? Why did so many people collaborate and how can we understand resistance and survival as complex and multi-faceted experiences? How can employing a global or comparative historical approach expand our understanding of the Holocaust? And finally, in what ways did the Holocaust bring about a revolution in human rights? Whenever possible, we will explore these questions through the first-hand perspectives. In addition to our shared course material, students will engage in their own independent research and writing projects. Throughout the semester we will work together to foster a supportive intellectual community. Meets the global and/or comparative requirement for the history major and can count towards the ""Law and Social Justice,"" ""Race and Indigeneity,"" or ""Global/Comparative"" fields.

On the other hand, there are other coexisting trends towards centrifugence and entropy. These include: acute alienation of the individual, a resurgence of ethnic and racial chauvinism, religious intolerance, deepening immiseration and marginalization of hundreds of millions of people, the collapse of polities, livelihoods and ecological systems, and war.

,,,,,,"From Italian Mafia dons to famous American philanthropists; from the knitting of ""trauma teddies"" in Helsinki to gift shopping in London; and from ceremonial exchange rings in Melanesia to the present day global refugee crisis: this course will investigate how generosity is understood and practiced in global perspective. We’ll begin the semester by examining key debates surrounding reciprocity, gifts, and exchange, theories of altruism and generosity, and patron-client relations. We’ll then explore the birth of the ""humanitarian spirit,"" and the complicated ethics and politics of humanitarian intervention. We will compare diverse religious traditions’ approaches to giving, including Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and Jainism. And we’ll explore contemporary debates surrounding volunteerism within sectarian and neoliberal political regimes.

In Japanese language courses, students learn the norms (i.e., what is considered to be correct and proper) regarding honorifics, speech levels, orthography, the so-called gendered language, and other linguistic forms. In this linguistics course, they will find out how actual speakers/writers observe or deviate from the norms to create sociocultural meanings and how the adherence to or subversion of the norm often reflects language ideologies. In the process they will reflect on their own as well as others’ speech and writing, and learn how to critically evaluate and analyze language in the media. In addition to reading and discussing academic articles in English, students will collect and analyze authentic Japanese data such as anime, TV drama, films, manga, novels, and blogs. Japanese Language and Culture majors who are juniors and seniors may count this course as their capstone experience.

How can we conceive of Latin America’s multiracial demographics and cultures or the place of the diasporic Latinx populations across the Americas, Europe, and the world?  Why are Latin American countries often considered “traditional” societies despite the region’s crucial role in the inception of global modernity and its urbanized, industrialized, and cosmopolitan present?  How do these fluidities manifest across racial, class, or gender lines?
These are some of the questions we will address in this course, which will consider the history of “Latin America” by engaging persistent metaphors marking the region’s identity. While presenting a roughly chronological overview, this course will emphasize the historical and contemporary resonance of motifs like “the Conquest,” “the Future,” and “Border Crossings.” As such, our conversations will consider the roots of present-day Latin America and its linkages (and divergences) from its past.

The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling.

,,,,,,"Public health is an integral but often overlooked aspect of the historical development of Latin America and the Caribbean. While it is hard to generalize about such a diverse region, many countries (e.g., Cuba, Chile, and Costa Rica) have achieved ""first-world"" standards of public health despite relatively low levels of economic development. Health has also been a key issue in debates about the scope of national welfare states, and intersects with many other social and political issues, such as the role of women in society, race and ethnicity, and social inequality. This interdisciplinary course draws on the instructor’s research experience as a health geographer who focuses on current and historical public health issues in Latin America. Topics to be covered include the impact of epidemic diseases in the European conquest of the New World; medical pluralism, complementary and alternative health practices, including indigenous medicine; hygiene, sanitation, and the shaping of urban environments (special focus on Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro); race, nationalism, and health in the Latin American eugenics movement; social medicine, socialist health systems alternatives, and the development of the Latin American welfare state; geopolitics and US hegemony in international health institutions (focus on the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pan American Health Organization); malaria eradication in Latin America—where it succeeded, where it failed and why; the politics of family planning, birth control, and abortion starting in the 1960s; the HIV/AIDS epidemic and national responses starting in the 1980s; and the national responses to the Covid-19 pandemic of recent years. Students will apply new perspectives and methodologies in a collective research project on historical or contemporary issues in Latin American public health. Prerequisites: none. Spanish or Portuguese language skills desirable, but not required.

In a sense, you will be studying yourself, since you are a prime example of a language user. Most of your knowledge of language, however, is unconscious, and the part of language that you can describe is largely the result of your earlier education, which may have given you confused, confusing, or misleading notions about language. This course is intended to clarify your ideas about language and bring you to a better understanding of its nature. By the end of the course you should be familiar with some of the terminology and techniques of linguistic analysis and be able to apply this knowledge to the description of different languages.

,,,,,,"This course aims to give students the opportunity to find the joy of analyzing Japanese language by enhancing their understanding of its complex and rich sociocultural meanings. In Japanese language courses, students learn the norms (i.e., what is considered to be correct and proper) regarding honorifics, speech levels, orthography, the so-called gendered language, and other linguistic forms. In this linguistics course, they will find out how actual speakers/writers observe or deviate from the norms to create sociocultural meanings and how the adherence to or subversion of the norm often reflects language ideologies. In the process they will reflect on their own as well as others’ speech and writing, and learn how to critically evaluate and analyze language in the media. In addition to reading and discussing academic articles in English, students will collect and analyze authentic Japanese data such as anime, TV drama, films, manga, novels, and blogs.

In Japanese language courses, students learn the norms (i.e., what is considered to be correct and proper) regarding honorifics, speech levels, orthography, the so-called gendered language, and other linguistic forms. In this linguistics course, they will find out how actual speakers/writers observe or deviate from the norms to create sociocultural meanings and how the adherence to or subversion of the norm often reflects language ideologies. In the process they will reflect on their own as well as others’ speech and writing, and learn how to critically evaluate and analyze language in the media. In addition to reading and discussing academic articles in English, students will collect and analyze authentic Japanese data such as anime, TV drama, films, manga, novels, and blogs. Japanese Language and Culture majors who are juniors and seniors may count this course as their capstone experience. The course also fulfills the Asian Studies, Japanese, and Linguistics major and minor requirements. Prerequisite: JAPA204 or permission of the instructor.

,,,,,,"While the most visible signs of cultural globalization involve mainstream corporate products like Disney films, fast food chains, and blue jeans, underground and alternative cultural phenomena are also marked by their entanglement with a globalized economy, international communications technologies, diasporic communities, and other forms of transnationalism. By directly examining the products and practices of cultures labeled as dissident, subversive, or otherwise “alternative,” from the Pachuco subculture in the 1940s to punk music and identity in the 1980s to hip hop culture in Japan and beyond, this course will ask critical questions about their transnational character. How do alternative identities express forms of both national and international belonging? What happens when alternative or oppositional identities are taken up outside of their “original” national contexts? Is this merely a miniature version of “cultural imperialism” or homogenization? How have international subcultures constructed unique networks of communication and exchange, both outside and within mainstream institutions or mediums? And, importantly, what are the political stakes of these transnational phenomena that are sometimes characterized as mere fashion trends or youth culture fads? How might we rethink terms like “subculture,” “counterculture,” and “fringe”? To explore these questions, we will draw on key theoretical texts, music, film, and other media, and a series of historical and contemporary case studies.

Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner’s music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in ""jazz"" by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell’s young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, ""One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn’t, the wolves and blizzards would be at one’s throat all the sooner.""

Where did the desire to conceive of music as representation come from, when and where did it emerge historically, and what political, ideological, and aesthetic paradigms does such an idea reflect, reinforce, or reject? In this course, we will trace music’s developing sense of autonomy, its changing relationship with words and its eventual freedom from them, from the Middle Ages through the late eighteenth century. We will look closely into musical works in the primary genres of European music in the Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical eras: mass, motet, madrigal, variation, suite, opera, concerto, symphony. As such, we will engage with modal and tonal repertories, as well as music that exists in the space in between those fixed categories. Course readings in musicology, critical theory, and history will provide a framework for understanding how these repertories responded to changes in intellectual and political life, bringing about profound transformations in what people (composers and performers, patrons and audiences, critics and philosophers) believed music was for and what it could do, what it could say without saying. If in the European Medieval imagination music was fundamentally an adornment of the Word, by the end of the eighteenth century, its powers of signification had developed to the point where commentators would feel justified in claiming that some pieces of music were ""about music itself.""

,,,,,,"The Philosopher Aristotle said ""without friends no one would choose to live, though they had all other goods"". (Nicomachean Ethics, 1055a 5-7). It is not clear exactly what Aristotle means by this, but the high value he gives to friendship and love is shared by many other ancient Greek and Chinese Philosophers, such as Plato, Epicurus, and Confucius. This class will begin with an overview of central themes in ancient and contemporary philosophy -- epistemology, metaphysics and ethics -- and then undertake a detailed investigation of friendship and love:  Why are friendship and love valuable? How do we become friends, and when should we break off friendships? With whom can we be friends: family members? pets? on-line friends? AI? Is ’romantic’ love real or merely a social construction? Should we love only one other, or many, or everyone? Could it be good for us to have no friends, or should we have as many friends as possible? What role, if any, does gender play in friendship and love? What, if anything, do we owe to our friends and lovers? We will consider texts by Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Sappho, Confucius, Montaigne, Kant, Emerson, de Beauvoir, Sartre, as well as several contemporary philosophical perspectives on friendship and love. We will also read works of literature, such as Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and love poems of Emily Dickinson, and view together several films, such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Your grade will be based on three short papers, two ’take-home’ examinations, reading responses (’convos’), and attendance/participation.

,,,,,,"What matters in life?  Is pleasure the only thing that matters?  If so, whose pleasure should I pursue-just my own, my family’s, or everyone’s? Does suffering matter, too? What about the suffering of non-human animals? Is it okay for me to make animals suffer in order for me to enjoy the pleasure of eating their flesh? Or how about the suffering of people who are really far away from me-say, on another continent? Is it okay for me to spend money on cool stuff for myself when instead I could donate it to help people who are suffering very badly far away?  If things in life other than pleasure matter too, what are they? People who oppose torture think that it’s wrong to hurt one person really badly even in order to prevent a large number of people from being hurt.  Are they right?  Is it always wrong to treat someone as merely a means to an end? Is it in general wrong to do things to people without their consent?  Why?  When do people deserve to be praised or blamed for their actions? What kind of person should I be?  Should I try to be happy? Or should I try to be virtuous? Is virtue its own reward? Or are we all inevitably faced with a choice between being virtuous and being happy?  If we are faced with that choice, which one should we pick?  In Ethics, we will talk about these questions, and others.

,,,,,,"This Foundations course is designed to introduce students to the study of International Relations (IR) as an academic discipline.  The primary goal of the course is to develop a substantive understanding of the history of IR, both as a set of political realities and as a field of study. To this end, it first provides an overview of historical non-Western international systems (the international relations of the historical Chinese, Indian, Islamic and other often-overlooked world orders). It then introduces students to key concepts, theories, and perspectives in contemporary International Relations. Next, it examines the defining processes, actors, and norms across the major domains of international relations: law/organization (sometimes called ‘global governance’), foreign policy, international security, and international political economy. Finally, it rounds out this foundational coverage with a consideration of the inherently “tragic” nature of international relations.
Each class session will be organized as a “lectorial” – that is, as a hybrid learning and teaching session that combines elements of both formal lecture (for delivery of content) and interactive seminar (for student group activities, discussion, etc).

,,,,,,"What does it mean to theorize “the political”?  How does one undertake such an inquiry? What is the relationship between the political, the economic, the social, and the cultural? This course is designed to help students answer these questions and introduce them to the field of Political Theory. We will explore the work of some the most influential thinkers in the history of political thought – namely, Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Arendt. We will also engage contemporary scholarship in the discipline and try to understand where Political Theory is headed today.

This course is designed to help students answer these questions and introduce them to the field of Political Theory. We will explore the work of some the most influential thinkers in the history of political thought – namely, Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Arendt.

But those are only the starting points for many questions that interest political science, including the contributions of social movements and political institutions, and the limits of courts within public policymaking. In addition to reading decisions of the Supreme Court, the course emphasizes the wider historical movements and cycles of constitutional politics. Major topics include speech, religion, privacy, the many types of discrimination (including racial, gender, sexual orientation), aspects of the criminal justice system, and the regulation of guns. Interest in law is helpful but no background is not required. Students able to bring perspectives from other national traditions are warmly welcomed. Class time offers a mix of lecture, dialogue, and small group discussion. Short assignments include observing state and federal appellate courts in Minnesota. A longer assignment will involve writing a decision in the style of a judicial opinion in a case currently before the courts. Students will join in “moot court” activities involving oral arguments in the manner of American appellate courts, ending with an intramural tournament supported by the college’s moot court team.

Biopower emerges gradually in secular capitalist modernity as a form of power that legitimizes itself not through its right to ""take life"" (as in traditional forms of sovereignty) but through its obligation to protect and enhance life. Yet, albeit ""secular,"" biopower is a form of ""pastoral power"" (Foucault).

This resolution acknowledged the inordinate impact of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as the crucial role that women can and do already play in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts. It urged states and other actors to increase the participation of women - and to incorporate gender perspectives - in all peace and security efforts. Since 2000, there have been nine additional resolutions that together have created the Women, Peace and Security agenda, a global framework for advancing gender equity in all areas of international peace and security. This course will explore feminist scholarship on armed conflict, peace and security leading up to the adoption of UNSCR 1325, as well as the 20 years of research, policy and practice on Women, Peace and Security. We will focus on the contributions and limitations of the WPS agenda as well as on new themes and issues that have emerged over time.

,,,,,,"How do people remember, learn, and make decisions? Philosophers have considered these questions for millennia, but in the last century the questions have been taken up in the relatively newer fields of psychology and cognitive science. Recently, significant progress has been made in applying our understanding of human cognition to larger societal goals and challenges. In this FYC, we will take a psychological approach to the study of human mental processes such as memory, attention, problem solving, and learning. Equipped with evidence-based theories of the mind’s sophisticated yet quirky workings, we will examine how recent advances can be used to dispel popular myths about human cognition, and point the way to societal improvements in the areas of criminal justice, education, and bias-reduction. Our readings will include both primary sources and popular writing from scholars and public intellectuals.

Current issues are examined within an integrative framework that begins with a focus on neuroanatomy, functional neural circuits, and diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems. This lays the groundwork for later study of the neural substrates of motivated behaviors (e.g., eating, sex, sleep, drug use), learning, memory, emotion, as well as aspects of neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Research methods and tools of behavioral neuroscience are featured throughout the course, through careful examination of primary journal articles and through hands-on experiences in weekly laboratory sessions. Science is a methodical process, and we will approach topics in this course through that lens. Fulfills Group A requirement for the Psychology major. Prerequisite(s): PSYC 100 or PSYC 180

The course inquires into the problems of defining and analyzing religious cultures, and the researcher’s position or positions in this analysis, as this has been approached from anthropological, sociological, and religious studies perspectives.

It flourished in its classical form after the age of the Buddha (5th century BC) and served as a scholarly lingua franca in India until the Islamic period. This course serves as an introduction to the grammar an script of Sanskrit, and we will advance to a point of reading simplified texts from the classical epic Ramayana.Students will be expected to attend class regularly and spend at least ten hours a week outside class studying the grammar and vocabulary. Without this sort of effort, no progress is possible in such a complex language. In addition to the rigorous study of the language, we will consider both the role of the language in classical Indian culture and religion, and some texts from the Ramayana, looking at both English translation and Sanskrit originals.

Biopower emerges gradually in secular capitalist modernity as a form of power that legitimizes itself not through its right to ""take life"" (as in traditional forms of sovereignty) but through its obligation to protect and enhance life. Yet, albeit ""secular,"" biopower is a form of ""pastoral power"" (Foucault). We shall explore: the interconnectedness of modern biopower and religion; Marx’s critique of the dominant (Enlightenment) critique of religion and his thesis that the secular state presupposes religion; the colonial and racial constructions of religion; racial capitalism; the biopolitical constructions of race in its relation to social class and other forms of domination; and anti-racist criticisms of both Foucault and Marx.

How do we think about the continuities and discontinuities among historical, autobiographical, and fictional representations of Malcolm X? Questions we will explore include: Who is representing Malcolm, how and why? How are the various representations inflected by their respective media and genre? Why do we engage in myth-making? Can we distinguish Malcolm the man from Malcolm the myth? How does the religious studies category of “hagiography help us to understand some representations of Malcolm X?

,,,,,,"The course introduces students to the sociological imagination, or ""the quality of mind essential to grasp the interplay of individual and society, of biography and history, of self and the world,"" as C. Wright Mills described it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples’ lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization.

,,,,,,"The Far Right in the United States has appropriated working class identities to produce an identity among the white working class. Donald Trump, for instance, intentionally portrays a large gap in highbrow and lowbrow to take jabs at privileged liberals (such as when he tweeted the ""Hamberder"" photo). This course observes what can be called the Far Right ""theater of politics"" in order to understand how liberals have left working class culture behind in ways that allowed the far right to fill the void by finding persuasive techniques in culture (country music, religion, church...) to articulate a political voice that some working class folks, especially whites, may find appealing. Some of the major questions of the course include: (1) How do political and economic elites produce class, gender, and racial divides and segmentations by aligning themselves with the cultural practices often associated with working class folks? (2) Can the left create a political culture that cultivates respect for organic cultural expressions that include religious expressions and pop-cultural themes like country music and sports (yes, even football!) into their fold  Reducing everything to class and asking all others to submit to its political logic is a limited vision. Instead, the course investigates whether it is possible to envision a political project that rather than privileging the concerns of upper-middle class whites produces a culture of resistance that can articulate working class subjects - straight, queer, white, black, binary, non-binary - into a populist left movement? One of the truly powerful features of the Left is that it is much more diverse than the Far Right.

We will question taken-for-granted assumptions about the child as we explore how understandings, representations, and experiences of childhood vary across historical, cultural, and geographical contexts. Examining the significance of race and ethnicity, social class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, and disability within children’s lives, we will consider the diverse experiences of childhood. Core themes include the social construction of childhood, children’s agency, and debates surrounding children’s rights in a global context. We will consider various case studies of contemporary children’s and youth issues, including growing up trans and what that reveals about society’s ideas about gender identity more broadly; how children cope and recover following disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and wildfires; and how children and youth can participate and lead in electoral politics and social movements. Finally, we will discuss contemporary research on how, why, and with what consequences the transition to adulthood has become stratified, scrambled, or only partially realized because of systems of oppression and privilege. These systems shape people’s opportunities in higher education, paid work, partnering, parenting, and living independently. Assignments will encourage students to bring a critical perspective to images and narratives of childhood.

,,,,,,"This course, which has no prerequisites, examines the deep structural crisis of the entire edifice of our political and economic system that some call progressive neoliberalism, characterized by a market-based economy wrapped in progressive sounding diversity politics. The course title reflects a predicament described by Antonio Gramsci in the 1930s, but that may be more salient today: ""’the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old order is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear."" The morbid symptoms of our own old order can be seen in the severe and increasing inequality. The two beneficiaries of this system are (1) those who are at the apex of the system, the so-called 1% and (2) the highly-educated elite professionals, intellectuals, and managerial class, the next 9% and sometimes called the clergy or the secular high priests of the system. The remaining population, largely composed of less educated whites, minorities, blacks, and women are being further and further removed from the rewards of the system. This hyper-inegalitarian system of rule is now experiencing a legitimacy crisis by both the far right and the left, but no true alternatives have yet been proposed to reform or replace it. The far right wants to take us on a path of racial white supremacist rule and further escalate inequalities and prepare us for possibly even a more sinister form of a postcapitalist society. The far left, on the other hand, wants to create a system of radical democracy and respect for nature that has the potential for replacing capitalism with a new historical system based on a more just foundation. This course will identify what was historically in place, capitalism’s distinctive dynamics so that we may better determine what is needed to resolve it. With that in mind, as Nancy Fraser has argued, we need to seek a path forward that leads beyond the current impasse -- through political realignments to societal transformation. We will explore what this capitalist system is, how it functioned historically, where it is now, and what systems may replace it in the future. To cover all that in one course is exciting and may help us think about some possible futures we can begin to imagine and work toward.

Broadly, we will examine the complex and multifaceted relationship between suburbs and cities, analyzing the theoretical underpinnings that have shaped the dynamic between them. Additionally, we will explore: the allure and deceit of the American Dream, scrutinizing how this ideal has been both a driving force and a source of disillusionment for many suburbanites; the spatial and possessive logics of whiteness, examining how suburbanization has been intimately tied to the construction and maintenance of racial hierarchies; and the political importance of the suburban homeowner as a voting bloc, looking into how this group has wielded significant influence in local, state, and national elections. Moreover, through examining suburban architecture and its surrounding built environment, we will also explore the gendered, sexual, and social control functions of the single-family home, the highway, and the shopping mall as normalizing structures designed to regulate and shape our behavior and values. Finally, thinking critically about what it means to participate in placemaking within these broader themes, we will close by theorizing together about the significance of rejecting the “cruel optimism” of the suburbs amidst the recapture of city centers by the forces of financial capital.

These students are comfortable speaking Spanish, but their literacy in it was not necessarily developed by formal schooling. Leaning on all of their previous experience with the language, the course seeks to enrich and complement the students’ linguistic repertoire by further developing their communicative abilities, both verbal and written, especially in an academic context. Class content will focus on Latin America and the U.S. Latinx population. Students will gain increased confidence in the language and will strengthen their identity as bilinguals and abilities to interact with a more diverse group of speakers, pursue higher-level courses and/or apply this knowledge in their professional endeavors, inside or outside the United States. This course is the equivalent to SPAN 305 for those interested in the Spanish major or minor. (Students cannot earn credit for both 305 and 306).

,,,,,,"From Caitlyn Jenner to Laverne Cox, CeCe MacDonald to Chelsea Manning, Transparent to Pose, trans people are experiencing unprecedented media coverage. In fact, some years ago now Time Magazine declared that we are at the ""transgender tipping point."" And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see a massive wave of legislation across the country seeking to limit trans people’s access to public space, to healthcare, and to self-determination. Alongside this, The National Coalition of Antiviolence Projects reports that 2020 saw a record number of murders of transgender individuals, in particular trans women of color. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In this class, we will ask: What has gender non-conformity meant in various historical moments? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice?

In fact, some years ago now Time Magazine declared that we are at the ""transgender tipping point."" And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see a massive wave of legislation across the country seeking to limit trans people’s access to public space, to healthcare, and to self-determination. Alongside this, The National Coalition of Antiviolence Projects reports that 2020 saw a record number of murders of transgender individuals, in particular trans women of color. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In this class, we will ask: What has gender non-conformity meant in various historical moments? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans embodiment and politics open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise?

How do people of various gender identities envision a better state yet-to-be (utopia) as well as a fear of catastrophe or nightmare (dystopia)?  This course investigates how women’s literary writing from different parts of the world (Bangladeshi, British, African-American, Canadian, to name a few) produce visions of the present and the future, of the real and the imagined, beliefs about masculinity and femininity, socialist and capitalist philosophies, modernity, the environment (ecotopia), and various technologies including cybergenetics.  Texts by Thomas More, Frantz Fanon, Silvia Federici, and Noam Chomsky, and music by The Eagles and A Tribe Called Red are included.  We will explore how these texts provide some ways to think about our gendered, racialized, and classed roles, and how we can think about MeToo, Black Lives Matter, Charlottesville, and neoliberal nation-states, along with our own fantasies and realities of sociopolitical change.

We will trace a wide range of practices and processes and study how gender and sexual politics intersect in art with race, class, sovereignty, Indigeneity, citizenship, and migration at particular historical moments and within specific geopolitical contexts. We will begin with an overview of the history of feminism and feminist art in Europe and the United States but quickly extend our study to contemporary  examples of feminist art, gender, and sexualities as they have been articulated by artists based in Africa, Australia, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Russia. During the course of this semester, students will develop an understanding that feminism is not an assumed, universal category or identity. Rather it is a constellation of different ideologies that contests heteropatriarchy, transphobia, racism, xenophobia, ableism, ageism, and religious fundamentalism. We will explore how transnational feminist trends and the LGBTQIIA+, nonbinary, genderqueer artists and communities expand our vision for justice and allow us to see the complex demands for political and social change globally.
