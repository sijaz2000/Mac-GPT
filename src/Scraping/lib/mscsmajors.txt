General Distribution Requirement:
All courses in the department count toward the general distribution requirement in mathematics and natural science except those numbered COMP 154, MATH 212, COMP 325 and COMP 272. COMP 154 and MATH 212 count toward the humanities general distribution requirement. COMP 272 counts toward the social science general distribution.  COMP 325 counts for no general distribution.General Education RequirementsCourses that meet the general education requirements in writing, quantitative thinking, internationalism and US identities and differences will be posted on the Registrar's web page in advance of registration for each semester.Additional information regarding the general distribution requirement and the general education requirements can be found in the graduation requirements section of this catalog.Honors ProgramThe MSCS department participates in the honors program. Eligibility requirements, application procedures and specific project expectations can be found on the department webpage or the Academic Programs and Advising Office.Topics CoursesCOMP 194 , COMP 294 , COMP 394 , COMP 494 , MATH 194, MATH 294, MATH 394, MATH 494, STAT 194, STAT 294, STAT 394, STAT 494 Selected topics in computer science, mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics.
